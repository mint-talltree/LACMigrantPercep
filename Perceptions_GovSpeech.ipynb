            "Good evening UNC family! When I see so many of you here tonight I know that change is going to come.\n",
            "We completed our internal elections, and I wish to congratulate our new Chair of the Women’s Arm Ms. Kenya Charles.\n",
            "I am happy to announce that we will be starting screening for local government elections this week.\n",
            "They are now in their last lap – the last year of this Rowley-led PNM administration, and their legacy will be that they made the lives of citizens harder, criminals are running rampant, tens of thousands are without work, our health sector is in critical condition, and the education sector is in shambles, roads, bridges, drains destroyed.\n",
            "Today, they go around cutting ribbons to announce projects. They have spent $223 billion dollars in four years, and they cannot cut ONE RIBBON TO OPEN OR COMMISSION ANYTHING…WHERE THE MONEY GONE?\n",
            "But, expect that in the coming months they’ll use every trick in the book to try to show that they are working – but they don’t need a Sobers, they need Houdini to convince Trinidad and Tobago, they are worth anything.\n",
            "They will come with the Budget and promise all kinds of things, but do not be fooled!\n",
            "The people of this country have had enough of Rowley, his Sobers (Stuart), Imbert, Rohan, ALL ALL ALL of them and when elections do come around, we will vote them out.\n",
            "Trinidad and Tobago is in desperate need of rescue from this disaster of the Keith Rowley Government.\n",
            "The United National Congress is ready – as you already know, we have a vision and plan to get T&T working again. Over the past few months I have been sharing our plans with you and tonight I will continue to share our vision to save our country.\n",
            "I heard that the Prime Minister said he’s holding the date for the Local Government election “close to his chest”. Tonight, I want to say to him – take the weight off your chest. You and your party were never prepared for government. Let go – call the election now and give the people of Trinidad and Tobago a fighting chance!\n",
            "Govt Hiding the Facts on TT’s Energy Sector\n",
            "My friends, tonight, here in Fyzabad, in this Fyzabad Secondary School, I want to speak about the criminal act of Keith Rowley and his Hatchet-Man; Wilfred Espinet, in the closure of Petrotrin.\n",
            "But first, let me remind you that Rowley told the country that Petrotrin would not be shut down. that was a lie.\n",
            "The Hatchet-Man told him that the problems of Petrotrin cannot be solved and closure was the only course of action.\n",
            "How did Rowley respond? Rowley asked no questions, Rowley did not fight to save your jobs, Rowley did not fight to save your communities, Rowley did not fight to save your businesses.\n",
            "In fact while they were in discussions with the union about improving Petrotrin, like a thief in the night, he stabbed the workers in the back and shut the company down.\n",
            "Today I am in Fyzabad and I, Kamla Persad- Bissessar as the Leader of the UNC promise you that I will fight to save your jobs, will fight to save your communities, will fight to save your businesses.\n",
            "You know me. I mean what I say, and I do it! I have demonstrated that I can do it. I have created thousands of jobs before, and with your support, I will put Trinidad and Tobago back to work again. How many of you remember when they tried to silence Tubal Uriah Buzz Butler as he addressed striking oil workers? Do you remember that the people protected Butler and put the Oppressors in full flight?\n",
            "Today I stand not far from Charlie King Junction and I ask you my people, when I fight for you, when I fight Rowley, when I fight the Rowley’s PNM, when I fight the Oppressors of the people, will I have your support?\n",
            "Like Uriah Buzz Butler; I Kamla Persad-Bissessar will not be muzzled; the UNC will not be muzzled. We will fight for what is right for the People of Trinidad and Tobago!\n",
            "Closure affecting families and communities\n",
            "When Rowley shut down Petrotrin; his Hatchet-Man; Wilfred Espinet, sent home thousands of people from jobs. Tens of thousands of families were adversely affected. You see, it is not only Petrotrin that sent home workers. The contractors and service companies that supported Petrotrin have also sent home workers.\n",
            "People have lost their homes. Some have returned vehicles that they can’t pay for. Others are in a state of depression. Many are planning to leave T&T.\n",
            "There were many service workers and employees of contractors who received no backpay and settlement from government. hundreds if not thousands are facing poverty.\n",
            "There is now an economic depression in South Trinidad from Mayaro to Point Fortin. Entire towns, villages and communities have turned into Ghost Towns.\n",
            "Marabella, Santa Flora, Siparia, Los Iros, La Brea, Cedros, Couva, Chaguanas, Penal, Gasparillo, Point Fortin, La Brea, Moruga, Princes Town, Mayaro…\n",
            "Thousands and thousands of people, fired by this shameless heartless government with no hope of getting employment anywhere. They promised jobs in the La Brea port…where are the jobs? They lied. They promised jobs from their secret Dragon Deal with Venezuela. They lied. Where has this government created jobs in south? Nowhere! They lied.\n",
            "New Companies set up\n",
            "When they shutdown Petrotrin they opened in its place four companies:\n",
            "1) Trinidad Petroleum Holdings (TPH)\n",
            "2) Heritage Petroleum\n",
            "3) Paria Fuel Trading\n",
            "4) Guaracara Refining\n",
            "We were told that these Companies were like the silver bullets for all the pains of Petrotrin.\n",
            "We were told not to worry – things were nice and going well with these companies.\n",
            "I am not fooled by Franklin Khan’s grin. Like Faris, he is fixing his business too. Rentals making millions! ent?\n",
            "I am not too sure about things being all well and good at all. You know not to trust the PNM. You know that they all lie.\n",
            "I want to know why the Minister of Energy had the audacity to report the revenue of Heritage Petroleum but said nothing about the profits?\n",
            "We have not seen audited financials for Petrotrin for 2018 but we are being given accounting information for Heritage Petroleum for 2019. They only want to show us information that make them look good. PNM Propaganda at work!\n",
            "My friends, our information is that things are not as nice as Minister Khan, Dr. Rowley and “Gary Sobers” (aka “The Minister of Everything”) would have us believe.\n",
            "Remember anything they touch turns to dust, they don’t have the Midas Touch. In fact, they have the REVERSED version of the Midas Touch – they have the Rowley’s Touch – everything Rowley touches ends in utter failure like the Shameful Sea Bridge, the Dead Dragon Deal and the BUSS UP Sandals to name a few. Rowley is not just sour and bad mind you know. That man is blight!\n",
            "Petrotrin and Fuel\n",
            "Let’s now turn our attention to Petrotrin and their role in supplying Trinidad and Tobago with fuel.\n",
            "As you will know all our super, premium, diesel, and other fuels were all made in the refinery at Pointe-a-Pierre.\n",
            "Now that the refinery is closed, a new company was established for the sole purpose of buying these fuels from the international market and selling to NP and Unipet. That company is called Paria Fuel Trading Limited. Its Chairman is one Wilfred Espinet (The Hatchet-Man) and its CEO is one Lisa Ali (formerly of BP).\n",
            "PARIA IS IN SERIOUS TROUBLE\n",
            "Our information is that this company (Paria) is already in serious financial trouble and this is a significant threat to the supply of fuel to the nation. Can you believe that in less than eight months this company is in major trouble? Rowley’s Touch again?\n",
            "I quote from a letter that was dropped in my mailbox. This letter is from one Wilfred Espinet to one Franklyn Khan. The letter is dated June 7th, 2019.\n",
            "It states, re: Update on Petrotrin Transformation Process.\n",
            "It lists “key immediate risks” as “An ongoing shortfall of $US 20 million per month to purchase refined fuels to ensure supply to the country – this is a structural problem that is going to result in a shortage of fuels unless corrected.”\n",
            "That is a very serious issue. The supply of fuel to the country is under threat and I didn’t say so.\n",
            "The Chairman of Trinidad Petroleum Holdings, Wilfred Espinet, said so. What is that $US 20 million shortfall about?\n",
            "Does that mean:\n",
            "(1) Are they are losing $US 20 million per month?\n",
            "Do you know what is US$20M converted to TT? At today’s rate of exchange it is $140 m TT. That is not losing money. It is hemorrhaging money!\n",
            "(2) They have to find $US 20 million of TT$ per month to buy fuel?\n",
            "(3) Do we have to increase the price of fuel at the pumps for the everyday citizen?\n",
            "Whatever it means, it is clear as day that Paria Fuel Trading, the company with the sole responsibility for importing this country’s fuels (super, diesel, premium, kerosene and jet fuel) is in big trouble.\n",
            "This is what you get when you shut down Petrotrin and you had no plan post Petrotrin. This decision to close down Petrotrin will be the biggest economic debacle in the history of this country. They a have made a complete mess of what was Petrotrin.\n",
            "The letter goes on to say that another immediate risk is:\n",
            "The failure to implement ex-terminal pricing for imported fuel; despite the Company and the MEEI having implemented a formula since November 2018\n",
            "This is why they recently rushed a piece of legislation to implement this formula. That was the amendment to the Petroleum Act and the Petroleum Production Subsidy and Levy Act.\n",
            "However, the Chairman is saying to the Minister of Energy that this should have been done since last year when Petrotrin was shutdown and we started to import fuel.\n",
            "That must be the height of incompetence on the part of the Smiling Franklin Khan as Minister of Energy.\n",
            "Mr. Espinet goes on to add another immediate risk. He cites:\n",
            "The inability to secure two letters from the Ministry of Energy and the BIR to close the 2018 year-end audit and finalise long term financing. Requests for both these letters have been pursued daily for several months.\n",
            "What does that mean? It means Petrotrin cannot publish financials for 2018 because of outstanding issues regarding royalty payments to the Ministry of Energy and outstanding issues regarding taxes owed to the BIR. This speaks to massive incompetence at the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Finance and at Trinidad Petroleum Holdings where all the Petrotrin accountants and finance people were fired and they can’t find documents.\n",
            "Petrotrin Bonds and Loans\n",
            "Next month Petrotrin has to pay $US 850 million dollars (more than $5 B TT) to bondholders it owes for a bond taken out in 2009 by the then Malcolm Jones PNM appointed board of Petrotrin.\n",
            "They cannot make that payment. So, they went to the bondholders and asked them to refinance the bond to 2026 at 9.75% interest. That is an excellent interest rate that no one remotely gets for their money in T&T.\n",
            "Although the offer was so good, almost half of the bondholders refused the offer. The result is they have HAD to borrow the remainder of the money to make the $US 850 million payment. This means they have to borrow that remainder from a syndicate of banks.\n",
            "The fact that half of the bond holders rejected such a good offer of 9.75% speaks volumes about their lack of confidence in Trinidad Petroleum Holdings the successor to Petrotrin.\n",
            "The bond holders were so dis-interested that the deadline for them to signal their intention to refinance was extended on three occasions.\n",
            "The question we ask is what will be the overall cost of refinancing this debt?\n",
            "It seems the Petrotrin candle is costing more than the funeral.\n",
            "And the people who have to bear that burden are you, your children and grandchildren.\n",
            "When you consider the loss of production, the loss of revenue, the loss of sales of refined products and the cost to settle with workers – the closure of Petrotrin is a debacle because it was not properly thought out but done with spite, malice and contempt.\n",
            "The Houston Hustle\n",
            "These are very serious issues. We are playing games with the country’s energy security which can lead to a massive crisis – a crisis we warned about last year. So, after four years of PNM they have killed Petrotrin and now they are killing the NGC.\n",
            "So we will get the financials for NGC for 2018 and the financials for the first half of 2019 and you will see that like Petrotrin, NGC is also in trouble thanks to political interference in natural gas price negotiations that went back to the infamous “Houston Hustle” of March 2017.\n",
            "This was when the Prime Minister and Stuart Young arrogated onto themselves the responsibility of negotiating natural gas prices for the NGC with EOG Resources in a hotel room in Houston.\n",
            "The result of that intrusion is on the one hand the NGC having to pay a lot more for natural gas while on the other hand having to sell it to its customers in some cases at a loss.\n",
            "We will hear more of this when we see the NGC’s accounts for the first half of 2019. Maybe that is one reason why Gerry Brooks hustled and resigned from the NGC – because he saw the writing on the wall.\n",
            "Franklin Khan’s Freudian Slip\n",
            "Now, just a couple weeks ago the PNM went down to Point Fortin to speak to their supporters, calling their rally “Let’s Talk Energy.”\n",
            "This is a national issue but Rowley chose to speak only to his party faithful.\n",
            "Maybe it was because Energy Minister Franklin Khan felt so comfortable amongst the PNM supporters that he forgot himself and let slip that the refinery will “most likely” be leased to a foreign operator.\n",
            "He said, “Guaracara Refining and terminalling (storage) facilities is very likely to be leased to a private operator. Very likely, an international operator because there is no indigenous capacity to run a refinery of that size and complexity. We will be focusing on Heritage”.\n",
            "So hard luck OWTU. Your bid – in the wastebasket. “No indigenous capacity.” That’s how highly your Government thinks of you.\n",
            "The OWTU of course didn’t take this statement lightly and called on the Minister to explain what he meant.\n",
            "Frankie’s response was to put out a strongly worded release, accusing the union of trying to create an issue\n",
            "But, I suppose after he realized just what it was he said, (or after his boss bouffed him) he tried to backtrack.\n",
            "Is it a case of the left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing?\n",
            "This Government has shown it cannot be trusted.\n",
            "We call on them to halt the sale of the refinery immediately until after the next General Election.\n",
            "And my friends, the UNC has a plan – we will reconsolidate Petrotrin into a fully integrated oil company, starting back up the Pointe-a-Pierre oil refinery on the most efficient and economical basis.\n",
            "By restarting Petrotrin, we will not have to import fuel and will avoid energy price risk, save foreign exchange, provide meaningful jobs and ensure the company continues to contribute to the Treasury.\n",
            "This PNM may not believe in you, the Rowley Government may not believe in the people of Trinidad and Tobago, but I do. I will put you back to work.\n",
            "PNM Takes Care of Their Own – FARIS CLAN\n",
            "This PNM Government has demonstrated this throughout their term – they are about friends, family, financiers.\n",
            "You will recall some months ago I revealed the details about the multi-million dollar rental contract for the family of none other than the Attorney General.\n",
            "There are two properties, One Alexandra Place and #3 Alexandra.\n",
            "Now it has been reported that there is no formal lease between the State and the family of Attorney General Faris Al-Rawi for the multi-million-dollar rentals at Alexandra Place.\n",
            "I have here a copy of a draft lease undated but referred to in same as in 2019 reveals that the proposed rental for One Alexandra Place is $600,000 plus Vat PER MONTH.\n",

            "Has the rental value of the land changed since?\n",
            "In that memo there is a request for the change of use from private residential dwelling house to commercial.\n",
            "How did they even build this multimillion-dollar building without approval? Nearly 10 years the building was rented out – but you’re now asking for change of use?\n",
            "Property 2 – #3 Alexandra Street – which the Cabinet led by Dr Rowley, and of which the Attorney General is a part – approved. It has been reported that the State has paid more $165 million in just under ten years for 1 Alexandra Place – reportedly with no formal lease.\n",

            "Keynote Address\n",
            "by\n",
            "Dr. Hon. Keith Rowley\n",
            "Prime Minister of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago\n",
            "Trinidad and Tobago Energy Conference 2023\n",
            "“Navigating a Complex Energy Future”\n",
            "Hyatt Regency\n",
            "January 23rd 2023\n",
            "It is my pleasure to be here with you all today at this the 2023 Energy Conference staged by the Energy Chamber of Trinidad and Tobago. The theme of this year’s Conference “Navigating a Complex Energy Future” is highly relevant as the global energy market is at a critical point and hydrocarbon countries like ours, and our neighbours Guyana and Suriname, must ensure that we are part of the conversations taking place.\n",
            "The ongoing energy crisis, the role of fossil fuels, issues of energy security and the cost and limitations of renewables, have highlighted the challenges of the energy transition. The situation is, as it always is, further complicated by geopolitics and we do have the Ukraine – Russian War which is undermining efforts to achieve energy security and energy affordability, across the world.\n",
            "The World Bank in its June 2022 global outlook reported that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions has steepened the slowdown in global growth. All this is happening in the middle of a stubborn pandemic.\n",
            "A key concern raised by the World Bank is the possibility of high global inflation accompanied by slow growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This according to the World Bank could result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies, which could have potentially harmful consequences on highly indebted developing and emerging markets. Therefore, Government and Business must work together to develop strategies to ensure that the pursuit of critical energy goals remains on track. This is even more important to energy-driven countries such as ours.\n",
            "This analysis is shared by many of our associate leaders and was a major plank in the discussions that Caricom leaders had with the President of the United States at the recently concluded Summit of the Americas. It is out of this background that President Biden proposed to us that we form a Caricom/US team chaired by Vice-President Kamala Harris and co-chaired by a Caricom leader (yours truly). The main focus of our assignment is to establish and develop sustainable energy security for the Caribbean region. This development has seen many contacts and discussions between Caribbean/US leaders and technocrats who are currently engaged in delivering on the promise of these new initiatives.\n",
            "In this uncertain global environment, energy is a key if not the major factor for economic growth which has a direct impact on standards of living. For industrialisation and economic development, economic growth and energy consumption have a positive and linear correlation. It is established that a rise in the level of energy consumption translates to a corresponding rise in the level of GDP. In the past year the importance of energy security has been brought to the forefront of conversations around the world.\n",
            "Global energy consumption rose consistently every year over the last two decades except for 2009 and 2020, following the global financial crisis and the coronavirus pandemic. We do not expect this pattern to be reversed anytime soon.\n",
            "In the last decade 2011 to 2021 energy consumption has grown by 1.3% over that period, with the increase in energy consumption being driven by Non-OECD countries. Energy consumption in Trinidad and Tobago has followed the trend of OECD countries with energy consumption falling marginally that is by 2.9% over the period 2011 to 2021.\n",
            "The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has predicted that by 2050, global energy use will increase by 50% compared with 2020, mostly a result of Non-OECD economic growth and population, particularly in Asia. Liquid fuels remain the largest energy source, but renewable energy use grows to nearly the same level at 27% of total energy consumption. Supply of petroleum and other liquids continue increasing to meet growing world demand through 2050. Natural gas production increases worldwide to help satisfy key demand markets and represents 22% of total project energy consumption. We, in Trinidad and Tobago, have been a part of the conversation professing the benefits and sustainability of energy security by using natural gas. Our Minister of Energy and Energy Industries the Hon. Stuart Young and myself spent significant time in 2022 having conversations globally as to the importance of natural gas and its derivatives and the role that Trinidad and Tobago plays and will continue to play in this particular space.\n",
            "Trinidad and Tobago, one of the earliest exporters of LNG and a country whose economy is very heavily dependent on sales of this product, has participated fully, at the highest levels of discussions of the recent forum of Gas Exporting Countries which was held in Qatar in February 2022. At that gathering it was projected that the demand and utilization of gas will grow steadily towards 2050 even as sustained efforts are made to bring about a reduction in general fossil fuel utilization.\n",
            "The increase in energy consumption has seen growth in global GDP by 27% over the period 2011 to 2021. However, based on the outlook of the IMF and other commentators such as the World Bank the prospects for global growth in the near term are not promising. The World Bank has predicted that global growth will drop from 2.9% in 2022 to 1.7% in 2023. The IMF in its October 2022 release predicted that global growth would fall from 3.2 percent in 2022 to 2.7 percent in 2023 and more recently on January 12, 2023 maintained its position. In monitoring the situation, the IMF has suggested that monetary policy should stay the course to restore price stability, and fiscal policy should aim to alleviate the cost-of-living pressures while maintaining a sufficiently tight stance aligned with monetary policy.\n",
            "Trinidad and Tobago’s GDP is closely aligned with the performance of the energy sector. With the volatility in energy prices, the contribution of the sector to GDP fell from 46.8 per cent in 2011 to 26.8 per cent of GDP in 2021. The preliminary results for 2022 show an improved contribution of 33.7 per cent of GDP due to the start-up of new major upstream projects and buoyant energy prices. However for 2023, the outlook is not as buoyant as oil and gas prices are predicted to be average to moderate, due to the global economic slowdown, tight hydrocarbon markets and OPEC’s conservative production strategy. The EIA has predicted that West Texas Intermediate, our benchmark crude, will average US$77 per barrel in 2023 as compared to the 2022 average of US$95 per barrel. Henry Hub is predicted to average US$4.90 per MMbtu in 2023 as compared to the average price of US$7.42 per MMbtu in 2022.\n",
            "The consistently low Henry Hub price, over the years, is the reason that we have committed so much effort aimed at moving away from Henry Hub and the Spanish fuel prices in the marketing arrangements for gas processed for LNG in the Restructured Atlantic LNG. The history and projections of the new marker prices show that they are superior to Henry Hub and will generate greater revenues for the country. This has been substantiated by the revenue earned for those LNG contracts that are already operating under these arrangements. We took on the task in 2018 and 2019 of beginning the difficult re-negotiating our energy contracts across the whole value chain and I am pleased to report that as a direct result of these negotiations the citizens of Trinidad and Tobago have been earning higher revenue for our gas from upstream, midstream and downstream due to the new formulae that were agreed to.\n",
            "Had these negotiations not been successful, given the lower production volumes, and the initial lopsided sharing of benefits then it is easy to calculate the dire consequences for the national revenue streams which we would have been experiencing at this time. Another important subset of the domestic energy sector is the downstream industry which is dominated by petrochemicals, ammonia and methanol. Within recent years the industry has had to overcome severe economic conditions brought on by faltering demand, oversupply and of course the pandemic. The growth in global GDP occasioned by increased demand and robust petrochemical prices has helped the industry to weather the storm. This has enabled a resurgence in the domestic petrochemical industry.\n",
            "Ammonia prices which fell to US$226 per ton in June 2020 have steadily increased reaching $1,300 per ton by the start of 2022. Argus Consulting Services in its 2023 Ammonia Outlook has projected a decline in ammonia prices from US$995 per ton in first quarter 2023 to US$445 per ton by the third quarter 2023. The decline in ammonia has been attributed to an oversupply which is generated by the prospect of an improved supply from Trinidad, Libya and Brazil and lower demand from European countries.\n",
            "Methanol, the other major petrochemical followed a similar path as ammonia. Methanol prices which fell to US$148 per ton in May 2020 steadily increased reaching US$437 per ton in October 2021 but have been trending downwards as supply exceeds demand. Argus Consulting Services has predicted moderate growth in 2023 with prices ranging between US$298 to US$328 per ton. These price movements are symptoms of the global energy commodity prices that we are subject to and one of the ways that my government has sought to mitigate the effects of volatility is the negotiating of new pricing formulae across the value chain.\n",
            "Based on information provided by the World Bank, through its World Integrated Solution, Trinidad and Tobago ranks as one of the largest exporters of ammonia and methanol. In 2021 Trinidad and Tobago’s exports of methanol were valued at US$1.53 billion or 17.7% of total global methanol exports and the country ranked second to Saudi Arabia. As regards ammonia, exports for 2021 were valued at US$1.68 billion or 19.2% of total global exports and the country ranked as the number one exporter.\n",
            "These achievements have been as a result of the collaboration of stakeholders, namely the Government, NGC and the Upstream, in managing a tight gas situation. In this regard NGC must be complimented for its role in ensuring the supply of gas to the downstream. This has been achieved through the execution of twenty-nine upstream gas sales contracts, ninety-seven downstream gas sales contracts and the resolution of “failure to supply gas” claims amounting to over TT$8 billion. The National Gas Company will shortly begin the round of discussions on new gas sales contracts.\n",
            "We are cognizant that the petrochemical industry is undergoing major changes. There is a universal and unrelenting movement towards low carbon and “greening” of petrochemicals. Therefore, if Trinidad and Tobago is to maintain its position, as a leading exporter of ammonia and methanol, or even as a mere participant in the future international market we must embrace the change. Current technology offers transitional abatement options to existing processes, such as carbon capture, utilization and sequestration, pending generation of feedstock from renewables. The initiatives for expansion of renewables in our energy mix and the development of a hydrogen economy is in keeping with our strategy for the greening of the economy, which includes the generation of renewable feedstock in the production of petrochemicals.\n",
            "We are in a period of global economic uncertainty. The outlook is subject to multiple risks which include worsening global growth prospects, the pace of recovery in China, macroeconomic uncertainties, a prolonged and deeper conflict in Ukraine along with protectionist trade policies. In this time of global market uncertainty one inescapable fact is that the world needs energy in increasing quantities to support economic and social progress and to build a better quality of life, in particular in developing countries. The question is, who will supply that energy and in what forms and volumes. It is Trinidad and Tobago and its Caribbean neighbours (Guyana, Suriname, Barbados and Grenada) expectation to be ever cognizant of the necessary changes to be made whilst remaining in the marketplace for energy as long as there is such a market for the careful supply of hydrocarbon products.\n",
            "Today most of the energy the world consumes comes from hydrocarbons, with crude oil being the dominant source of transportation fuels. Even with significant strides in improved energy efficiency, global energy demand is expected to rise by about fifty percent by 2050. All sources of energy are needed as the global population is projected to grow from current estimates of eight billion people to ten billion people by 2050. The United Nations in its 2022 Sustainability Report indicated its Goal 7 was not achievable. Goal 7 is about ensuring universal access to clean and affordable energy by 2030. However rising commodity, energy and shipping prices have increased the cost of renewables worldwide and it is estimated that some 670 million people will not have access to energy in 2030.\n",
            "The UN has determined that achieving energy and climate goals will require continued policy support and the mobilization of public and private capital for clean and renewable energy, especially in developing countries. The recently executed Agreement between the Government of Trinidad and Tobago and the Consortium of Lightsource bp, BP and Shell on the 112.2 Mw Solar Utility Project is an affirmation of the fundamentals required to achieve this objective.\n",
            "Construction of the Solar Parks is scheduled to commence in the first quarter 2023 with full operationalization of the Project by fourth quarter 2024. The Solar Utility Project will, on completion, meet 8% of the country’s power generation requirements. It is the Government’s stated objective to increase power from renewables to meet 30% of the country’s requirements. This current project is the largest in the English-speaking Caribbean and I have challenged the Ministry of Energy and Energy Industries, in a whole of Government approach, to move quickly to bring on more renewable energy projects on stream.\n",
            "A review of the country’s power requirements has projected peak demand to increase from the 1400 MW in 2022 to 1600 MW by 2032. During this period the PPAs of two of the country’s major independent power producers representing 40% of the country’s installed generation capacity are due to expire. We therefore have an opportunity to achieve much of the target of 30% of power from renewables. However the transition to renewables is not without its challenges. Prices for wind and solar power increased nearly 30 percent in the past year due to global supply chain issues, significant price increases for components and increases in labour costs in producing countries, reversing a decade of cost declines. Another hurdle, as encountered by the Solar Parks Project, is the competition with prevailing low cost of electricity in Trinidad and Tobago.\n",
            "Notwithstanding the current issues the outlook for renewables is technically promising but widespread cheap energy from these myriad sources are still some time away. Deloitte, in its new 2023 renewable energy industry outlook, predicted that while growing demand could exacerbate supply chain constraints the evolving trends that follow could help the renewable industry navigate the early headwinds and set the stage for faster growth in 2024.\n",
            "While our primary focus is the optimum development of our hydrocarbon resources, we cannot ignore the initiatives being taken globally to develop low carbon economies. In particular new legislation passed in the EU and US in 2022 are expected to provide momentum to renewables in 2023 with tax incentives, grant funding and other financial support for new technologies and existing projects. Other jurisdictions such as ASEAN countries, have found that the use of feed-in tariffs (FIT) as a price-based instrument combined with soft loans and tax incentives provide the highest performance in terms of the growth of renewable power and its cost-efficiency.\n",
            "In the near future we, in Trinidad and Tobago will be introducing Feed In Tariff legislation as part of our strategy to encourage low carbon power generation technologies and renewable energy generation. Feed-In-Tariffs have proven to be an effective policy instrument in encouraging investment in renewable energy technologies and in the growth of domestic renewable industries. It is currently being reviewed by the Ministry of Energy and Energy Industries and will be brought to Cabinet this quarter.\n",
            "We are currently at the early stage in the development of the domestic renewable energy industry. The Lightsource bp, bp/Shell Solar Parks can provide the impetus for the development of a renewable energy industry. We need to build on this experience. Our permitting process needs to be drastically shortened and we may need to review the suite of incentives if we are to attract further investment not only at the corporate level but also at the individual level. Given the global momentum, we must accelerate our transition to a low carbon economy as to delay necessary change will put at risk current and future energy related prospects, as energy transformation will have significant impacts on a broader economic scale.\n",
            "On November 29, 2022, the Government launched the Roadmap for a Green Economy in Trinidad and Tobago. The Roadmap was developed by the IDB in collaboration with the Ministry of Energy and Energy Industries and National Energy. The study determined that of all the potential renewable energy sources in Trinidad and Tobago, offshore wind offers the largest potential for the country with a projected output of approximately 25 gigawatts of levelized energy. The initial goal of the roadmap is the establishment of a wind pilot project, demonstrating visible end-use applications of green hydrogen in Trinidad and Tobago. Towards this end, the Ministry of Energy and Energy Industries in collaboration with National Energy and the European Union will be conducting a National Wind Resource Assessment, to identify potential sites for wind farm development in Trinidad and Tobago.\n",
            "While the outlook for development of renewable energy industry is promising and attainable, we recognise that renewables cannot in the near to medium term replace oil and gas. Long-term strategies that promote renewable energy and energy efficiency are necessary to attain carbon neutrality. Further, the shift to carbon neutrality is not a spontaneous event as there are a number of challenges such as the cost, reliability and stability of renewable energy systems. As a consequence, low-carbon technologies must be competitive in order to facilitate this energy transition. New breakthroughs in technology are making renewable energy reliable and viable. Notwithstanding, fossil fuels generally cost less than renewables. Therefore, the cost-competitiveness of renewable energy technologies will be one of the main factors dictating the pace of deployment.\n",
            "In the current global energy scenario our policy is to take a measured approach to the energy transition. In this regard we will be pursuing the accelerated exploration and development of our hydrocarbon resources as we transition to a lower carbon economy. Our strategy is not unlike that of countries, who, given the intermittency of renewable energy generation, and technical immaturity in storage are building a mix of energy sources, with high energy security. Others such as the Europeans, as reported by the Washington DC, Institute of Energy Research in its December 19, 2022 commentary on global energy markets, are facing an energy crisis due to reduction in the use of fossil fuels, the variability of renewable energy and the impact of Ukraine- Russian war. Yet other countries such as China and India are continuing to invest heavily in oil, natural gas and coal as well as nuclear and renewables to improve their national security and the welfare and economic well-being of their citizens.\n",
            "In my address to participants at the 2022 Energy Conference, I informed that we would be pursuing an aggressive bid-round programme for the exploration of our hydrocarbon resources. This programme was initiated with a deep-water bid-round our next frontier, in which we received four bids by a Consortium of BP and Shell. These bids are currently the subject of negotiations between the Ministry of Energy and Energy Industries and the Consortium. The deep-water bid-round was followed by the 2022 Onshore and Nearshore Competitive Bid Round which opened on July 8th, 2022 and closed on January 9th 2023. We received sixteen bids for eight of the eleven blocks that were offered. It is the most successful Onshore/Nearshore Bid-Round to date surpassing the Onshore/Nearshore Element of the 2005/2006 Bid Round in which eight bids were submitted for six of the eight blocks offered.\n",
            "The success of the recent Bid-Round is a testimony to policies introduced by Government, including constant engagement with stakeholders, to encourage upstream investment both onshore and offshore and the confidence of industry participants in the geological prospects of the Trinidad and Tobago provenance. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister of Energy and Energy Industries and his Team for a job well done. The bids are currently being evaluated by an Evaluation Team led by the Ministry of Energy and Energy Industries. The results of the evaluation will be disclosed within three months. This Bid Round will be followed by a shallow-water bid-round which is scheduled to be opened at the end of the first quarter 2023. The Ministry of Energy and Energy Industries invited and received nominations from upstream operators for the twenty-three eligible open shallow-water blocks. The Ministry is currently evaluating the responses in its determination of the blocks to be offered in the bid-round.\n",
            "Government intends to maintain the momentum of upstream exploration through improved fiscal incentives and the availability of acreage both on land and offshore. Accordingly, we will continue the dialogue with upstream companies on the incentives required to stimulate activity for the exploration of upstream resources. As a consequence of such dialogue, fiscal incentives as outlined by the Minister of Finance in the 2023 Budget Statement were approved and implemented by Government. The Ministry of Finance in collaboration with the Ministry of Energy and Energy Industries, will be continuing the engagement with upstream companies to assess and determine any reasonable and necessary additional fiscal stimuli which might be required to ensure that Trinidad and Tobago remains an internationally competitive hydrocarbon provenance.\n",
            "The competitive bid round process has been successful and has ensured that Trinidad and Tobago realise the optimum value from the exploitation of its remaining hydrocarbon resources. However, a number of countries such as Indonesia in order to maximize the exploration and development of their hydrocarbon resources have included a direct proposal arrangement. Given the uncertain global energy environment Trinidad and Tobago may need to consider such options to maximise the extraction of our hydrocarbon resources, both oil and natural gas.\n",
            "Natural Gas in particular is required as fuel for our power plants and as feedstock for our gas-based industries, inclusive of LNG and is currently at 2.8 bcf per day, down from about 4.1bcf at its highest, at peak production of our now matured fields. Gas production will improve in 2023 based on projects which came on stream in mid-to-late 2022 such as Shell’s Colibri project, BPTT’s Cassia Compression Project and EOG Resources Osprey West Project. Gas production will be given a further boost in 2023 by BPTT’s infill programme and EOG Resources Osprey East Development. In the period 2024 to 2026 projects with a production capacity of 1.5 bcf per day will serve to stabilize natural gas production pending the coming on stream of mega-projects such as Shell’s Manatee Project and Woodside’s Calypso project. However, there is much work to be done to bring these projects to Final Investment Decision. As a Government we are doing our part, working alongside the major explorers and investors, to expedite the process and we are quietly confident that these projects will be brought on stream at the earliest date.\n",
            "Crude oil is an important revenue earner and it has benefitted from the high crude prices in 2022, which, for domestic crude, averaged approximately US$100 per barrel. Production which had declined during the pandemic is on the rise and averaged approximately 59,000 barrels a day in 2022. The outlook in the near term is positive given the aggressive drilling programme of Heritage, the country’s largest oil producer, new production by EOG and Trinity, recent discoveries by Touchstone and the generous fiscal incentives made available to onshore producers and shallow water marine areas in recent times. We have been working tirelessly to encourage further increased onshore oil production and I hope to see success in this area as time progresses.\n",
            "As a small producer of gas Trinidad and Tobago exerts no influence on the gas markets. We are essentially a price-taker in a global energy sector which has a history of extreme price volatility and which is likely to persist in the future. The combination of price volatility, the uncertainty for future oil and gas markets and the push for de-carbonization and other climate control efforts has created a complex energy future. What is certain is that the global energy sector is undergoing transformational change. It is a challenging period which will require a clear vision, astute management and the seamless integration of mixed fuel systems.\n",
            "Transformation is not a single event but a journey, an ongoing process that requires adaptation based on ever-changing conditions and increased synergy between government and its stakeholders. Stakeholder collaboration is paramount in order to successfully manage the energy transformation. The Solar Parks Project is an example of such collaboration, as transpired between Government and Energy Sector Stakeholders, BP and Shell. It is about mutually beneficial, respectful relationship. We intend to deepen this relationship and draw on stakeholder experiences and investments as we navigate this complex and vital energy future. It is only from such co-operation that we will be able to meet the challenges that confront us. As a Government, we have had a fruitful relationship with you, our energy sector shareholders, local and foreign, and we look forward to your continued collaboration as we navigate the way forward.\n",
            "In closing, I wish to thank the Energy Chamber for the opportunity to deliver the keynote address to this distinguished audience and to provide Government’s take on “navigating a complex energy future”.\n",
            "To all our participants, particularly those who have traveled from abroad to join us, please have a great and rewarding conference and thank you very much for your kind attention. Please enjoy your stay in Trinidad and Tobago and we trust that you will continue to report favourably on us and our efforts here as we make this journey together.\n",

            "I am delighted to be able to join you this morning, as TTARP celebrates its 30th anniversary. The theme of this year’s anniversary celebrations is, as we have heard, “Together We Are Stronger”. I could not have imagined a better theme, myself. In fact, when one thinks about it, the words “Together We Are Stronger” are apt, not just as a theme for our anniversary celebrations, but as a powerful reminder to the entire country of the need for our citizenry to collaborate and cooperate with one another in our march towards community development and national advancement.\n",
            "You will notice that I have spoken about “our” anniversary celebrations. This is not simply because I am qualified, by reason of my age, to be part of the organisation (my husband has already teased me and told me that I am way over-qualified where that is concerned); rather, it is because I have had not only the good fortune to have been invited to be the organisation’s patron, but, so my husband has also told me (although, in this respect, he happens to be right), I have also had the good sense to have accepted that kind invitation. And so, I have spoken about “our” anniversary celebrations, in thankful recognition of the gift which the Universe has so kindly given me of this opportunity to be joined with you, in more ways than one.\n",
            "For 30 years, TTARP has been working tirelessly to enable persons aged 50 years and over to fulfil their greatest potential. One of the reasons I embraced the opportunity to be patron of the organisation so readily, is the invaluable and essential service the organisation provides to people in their golden—and, I dare say, their best—years. The other is because TTARP, as a non-profit civil organisation, is, I believe, a reflection of what is best about Trinidad and Tobago – our people’s willingness to give of themselves, in service to others, without seeking the least reward.\n",
            "Honouring our forebears and all who have gone before us, by making proper provisions for them in their later years, is a noble endeavour. In the Christian Bible, it is the only commandment to which a promise is attached: “Honour thy Father and thy Mother, and thy days shall be long in the land”. In West Indian societies, elder people have long occupied a special place in the family unit. Elder persons help raise grandchildren or other children of the family; ensure that valuable life skills and wisdom are passed on; and are often the glue that binds together the entire family unit. In the wider community, they are the stalwarts, community leaders and people who can be counted on to impart pearls of wisdom, knowledge and experience. Having worked for decades; raised generations; and contributed to the social and economic wellbeing of the country in both tangible and intangible ways, elder people have earned the right to be honoured.\n",
            "TTARP helps our nation to honour our elder population by advocating for and assisting them in many ways. This year’s anniversary Expo showcases just some of the many products and services that are geared specifically towards elder persons, by which TTARP tangibly honours our elder population. These include impressive discounts on a wide range of goods and services in more than sixty-two categories throughout Trinidad and Tobago. I look forward to viewing the ‘World of TTARP’ exhibition later, which is sure to answer more than a few of the public’s questions about TTARP, and provide a deeper insight into what membership in TTARP means and all that membership has to offer.\n",
            "Ageing can, and should be, a wonderful thing. In fact, some say that life begins at 50. However, growing older does come with specific issues and concerns, many of which TTARP’s efforts have gone a long way towards alleviating.\n",
            "One of the paramount concerns about getting older, is financial wellness. Retirement can mean financial insecurity as a result of the loss of an income. It can also leave one face-to-face with the inadequacy of one’s savings; and, where we depend on job-related retirement benefits, retirement can mean immeasurable stress when, as often happens, there are delays in receiving those benefits. Even if one is not retired, one can find oneself spending quite a lot of money on health and health-related issues, as one grows older. It is in this sphere – of mitigating the financial vulnerability of elder persons – that TTARP has perhaps most famously distinguished itself. TTARP has done so by entering into relationships with 400 discount partners and securing preferential rates for its members across a wide category of services, including optical, medical, dental, grocery items, insurance, utilities and much more. We—and notice I say ‘we’—are spoilt for choice when it comes to the products and discounts TTARP has made available to help defray our daily expenses and enable us to put up a better fight against rising prices. Thank you TTARP!\n",
            "Another challenge which many of us face as we get older, is that of isolation and loneliness. With time, children leave the home and get married; friends move into different neighbourhoods or pass away; and colleagues retire early and abandon us at our workplaces. Mobility and other physical limitations brought on by the ageing process, prevent some of us from participating in the activities we love – further reinforcing our sense of isolation. TTARP has stepped into this space as well, and provides a variety of opportunities for social engagement – with events such as international and local trips; and functions and limes as a TTARP family within various colourfully-named zones. I was amused to learn some of the zone names—the ‘Eastern Angels’ of Arima; ‘Royals’ of Princes Town/Rio Claro; ‘Purple Diamonds’ of San Fernando; and how can one forget the ‘Corals’ from Tobago!\n",
            "Outings and events such as these provide an opportunity for social engagement and promote a sense of belonging for us as we age. Events such as these also help make the case that I advanced at the beginning of this address, that there could not be a better theme than “Together We Are Stronger” where TTARP is concerned. As an organisation, TTARP truly understands and operates by this theme. Through TTARP’s efforts, many of us can now find community and friendship as we age, comfortable in the knowledge that we are not alone. Through TTARP’s efforts, our nation honours our elder population.\n",
            "I could go on and on, for days and days, about what TTARP has to offer – but then I suppose that would defeat the whole purpose of our Expo!\n",
            "Permit me, therefore, to walk down a slightly different road, and to focus TTARP’s attention on the critical role that I believe the organisation can, and should play, in what I described, when I began, as our country’s march towards community development and national advancement.\n",
            "I am speaking here about the role of mentorship. I referred earlier to the role that our elder citizens play in ensuring that valuable life skills and wisdom are passed on. I respectfully suggest that there is in our country, today more than ever, a growing need for elder citizens to mentor their younger charges.\n",
            "Looking around at our country today, we see too many examples of our youth gone astray – we see too many of them succumbing to the lure of all forms of antisocial and criminal conduct. I believe that positive and appropriate mentorship for our nation’s youth and younger adults, is a critical tool in showing our young people better ways to be; and in showing them better lives to live. And I wonder whether TTARP, by reason of the unique attributes of its members, might not well be in the perfect position to provide the very type of mentorship that I believe our young people need at this time. TTARP has, for example, among its members, some of the most distinguished and capable elder citizens this country has ever produced. As I understand it, TTARP’s membership comprises a wide cross-section of persons from every sector of the society, and from every field of social and cultural endeavour. And it is there, I believe, that TTARP has an advantage that few other organisations have – the advantage of a ready, an available, and an organised pool of mature members who have worked, lived and experienced almost every walk of life; many of whom are no longer weighed down by the responsibilities of daily employment and whose time and talents can therefore be turned towards mentoring youths and young adults.\n",
            "The beneficial effects of positive and appropriate mentorship upon the youth population and by extension, upon the wider society, hardly need to be stated. They include: increased secondary-school graduation rates; lower-secondary school dropout rates; healthier relationships and lifestyle choices; better attitudes about schooling and education in general; higher tertiary-enrolment rates; higher educational aspirations; enhanced self-esteem and self-confidence; improved behaviour, both at home and at school; stronger relationships with parents, teachers, and peers; improved interpersonal skills; and a decreased likelihood of starting drug and alcohol use.\n",
            "This is why I believe that, with appropriate mentorship, our country will put itself in a better position to develop healthier, happier communities and to advance as a people and as a nation. And, as I have said, I believe that TTARP’s membership are perfectly poised to provide the required mentorship. Perhaps, for example, such mentorship might include inviting more young people to TTARP’s outings and events, where they can mingle with their elders in a relaxed environment. It is said that the ‘4 Cs’ of a successful mentoring programme are Conversation, Connection, Community, and Culture. TTARP’s outings and events supply them all, and in ample measure. Whether by means of these outings and events, or by other, more formal means, I am confident that TTARP is possessed of both the imagination and the human-resource capacity, to mentor our nation’s youths and young adults, extremely successfully.\n",
            "And so, I want to encourage TTARP’s leadership, not only to keep up the Herculean work that it has been undertaking for the last 30 years, but, in the months and years ahead, to add to its already impressive body of work, a focussed concentration on mentoring our nation’s youths and young adults. When he was alive, my father, who was perhaps the greatest mentor in my own life, was often fond of saying that ‘The only reward for good work, is more work’. And so – there it is: for all of TTARP’s good work for the last 30 years, I have taken the liberty this morning of suggesting that it might consider undertaking some more work, this time in the area of concentrated mentorship. If my suggestion diminishes the likelihood that I will be invited to deliver the feature address at next year’s anniversary celebrations, at least it will have made my father proud.\n",
            "I know that I am certainly proud this morning. I am proud to be the patron of this organisation. I am proud of how TTARP has continued to advocate for the elder population of Trinidad and Tobago, and of how it has kept pace with the times, allowing persons to apply online to become members and providing other valuable information via its social media pages. And I am proud of all that I know TTARP will continue to do and to accomplish in our country as we, all of us, pull together in the knowledge that “Together We Are Stronger”.\n",
            "And so, let me in closing, once again wish TTARP a happy 30th anniversary. I am happy to join TTARP as we host our 30th anniversary Expo. I look forward to viewing the many products and services on offer— and who knows, perhaps I will yield to my husband’s teasing and avail myself of some of them!\n",
            "Happy anniversary and I wish you many, many more productive years to come.\n",

            "The Honourable the Chief Justice, Mr Justice Ivor Archie, O.R.T.T.\n",
            "Good day fellow citizens. Some of you may recall that, during my inaugural speech as Chief Justice, way back in 2008, I likened the Judiciary to a business corporation, and the citizens of Trinidad and Tobago to its shareholders and customers. It was a deliberate paradigm shift because I recognised that a change in philosophy and culture was a necessary ingredient for meaningful and permanent transformation. As I reiterated in 2010, and I quote, “what we have been trying to do is not just to put physical systems and procedures in place to dispose of cases, but to do so in a philosophical and psychological context that is grounded in the notions of service, accessibility and accountability. We believe this should be the minimum return on the investment made in us by our shareholders – the national community – especially when what is invested is their trust and their confidence. That approach also leads us to pay attention to cost effectiveness, … It requires us to look at the subjective customer experience and not just throughput rates. It requires us to develop an organisation that exists not for self-perpetuation, but one that anticipates and responds flexibly and proactively to a changing external environment, including most importantly, its customers’ expectations. Otherwise that part of our vision that speaks to maintaining public confidence in the administration of justice would be a mere platitude.”\n",
            "Today I bring you the chairman’s report. Walk with me as we briefly revisit our journey over the past decade. We will see the steps taken toward the fulfilment of the vision, the work that has been done over the past year, and the projections for the coming year. Remember the theme “People, Plant & Process” as we trace the path of transformation through focus on process reengineering, physical and digital infrastructure, and technical and human resource realignment!\n",
            "Where were we in 2010? We were operating in a paper-based environment. Our legacy case-management software JEMS was prohibitively expensive, not well supported by the vendors and no longer meeting our evolving needs. Our organisational structure did not adequately take account of the diversity of our customer base. Just to give a few examples of the steps on our journey:\n",
            "We recognised that drug addiction is a public health issuecriminogenic dimensions and not just a crime problem, so the Drug Treatment Courts were established; The criminal justice system treated children in conflict with the law like adults, not recognising their neurological and psychosocial differences and needs as criminogenic factors that required differentiated treatment if the aim is restoration and reintegration into the society. We partnered with UNDP and USAID as well as local stakeholders to transform the Juvenile Justice system up to and including new judges rules for children. Thus the Children Court was born providing a specialised suite of diagnostic and support services. We finally got rid of the awful concept of children ‘beyond control’! We now speak of CHINS- Children in need of supervision. The new nomenclature suggests a change that is both attitudinal and ameliorative rather than derogatory. New Criminal Procedure Rules were introduced to assist in the proper management of criminal matters; Systems for collection and disbursement of maintenance and payment of fines and fees were paper-based, required physical attendance with lost productivity for the judiciary and clients alike and did not take into account the fact that a large percentage of our population is unbanked. And so, CourtPay was born. As I mentioned last year, it is about more than payments, it’s about e-vote books, generation and reconciliation of accounts and reports and better audit trails and accountability. All this on our own in-house proprietary software; There is now an additional version of CourtPay, bringing more convenience to our customers; With Nigeria and the National Centre for State Courts, we formed the nucleus of a consortium to develop case management software with no licencing costs. That consortium has now grown to the extent that 22 interested countries were represented at the Consortium meeting in early October with Namibia being the latest to formallyWe will continue to benefit from innovations and improvements developed in any of the member countries and TT.jim, is now into its second iteration, thanks to that fruitful collaboration, whose product is on its way to becoming the gold standard internationally; Divisionalisation of the High Court and reducing the number of districts in the magistracy can now facilitate more focused management and efficient deployment of human resources.\n",
            "During the course of today’s presentation, we will highlight some of the major achievements and reforms that we continue to roll out in fulfilment of our mission. Suffice it to say that by the beginning of 2020, we were well poised to transition the judiciary to a place where we could leverage the best available technology in support of more rational, streamlined and effective work flows and processes.\n",
            "And then there was COVID-19……\n",
            "Crises present both incentive and opportunities for change. In order to maintain service delivery, some priorities were reordered and timelines advanced. Guided by our medical response team in the preservation of a safe environment and development of new protocols for court users, staff and facilities management, we have made the transition to e-delivery of justice quite successfully, and the expectations and desires of our clients have now shifted towards full acceptance. This is the new normal!\n",
            "Our most recent development, of which we are quite proud, is the roll out of our Judiciary Contact Centre. It is much more than a Call Centre, providing live assistance and opportunities for problem solving for whoever needs to navigate our systems. The Centre will move towards the increased use of information technology in the future to meet stakeholder needs. We recognised the need to be more user-friendly, particularly in an environment where our client s cannot simply walk in for guidance as the pandemic continues to affect us all (and in any event, why expend on and risk transportation when you could do it from home?).\n",
            "In terms of stakeholder engagement, we have restarted the Criminal Justice Sector Committee , and activated the Domestic Violence Process Review and Service Enhancement Committee, the ARC Programme with COSTATT, the UTURN collaboration, and the TT ICCS Codes Multi-Stakeholder Committee, to name a few.\n",
            "This is not by any means to suggest that everything is perfect. While we have been able to sustain an acceptable level of productivity, significant challenges remain, such as the inability to conduct jury trials because of the severe logistical problems.\n",
            "Last year, I had to point out that despite all our efforts, the reality of the COVID-19 pandemic for half of the year had an inevitable impact on our output. Little did we imagine at the time that we would have to experience a further full annual cycle under severe constraints. To be able to maintain (and in some areas increase) total disposition figures is a remarkable feat. In the civil division of the High court we actually disposed of 3025 matters a marginal uptick from last year. Of particular significance is the fact that 74% of matters were less than 2 years old at the time of disposition.\n",
            "The Children Court disposed of 594 matters, 95 more than the previous year.\n",
            "The news was similarly encouraging in the Family jurisdiction where there was an increase from 2,555 to 2,688 and I am happy to report that 72% of those were less than a year old.\n",
            "Owing to the absence of juries, the situation was more challenging in the Criminal jurisdiction but we managed to complete 30 matters including 8 murders. The Criminal division will be receiving focused attention this year as the logistics of providing enough large sanitised and socially distanced courtrooms for jury trials is likely to be a problem for some time\n",
            "For the next few minutes, we will share some of the more significant developments that have occurred since my last address. In keeping with the ethos of “team judiciary”, I will take a back seat and return a bit later as I first let some team members share their experiences. Thank you for your attention during this time.\n",

            "Court Executive Administrator\n",
            "Courts are complex organisations in which many moving parts must come together for individual cases to be heard and for all cases to progress. Each of these parts require resources, systems and processes all of which must be designed, implemented and managed. It’s a tall order as just over 150,000 new cases are filed each year to be heard by 111 judges, masters and magistrates. And all activities in these cases must be signed off on by 19 High Court Registrars and 17 Magistracy Registrars. To the individual user, what is seen is the simple scheduling and disposition of THEIR case: - the service that we provide to them.\n",
            "Aware of the fact that the Judiciary’s role is to provide a service to the public, we set about to review and transform the Judiciary’s structure, resources, and processes to address modern realities, identified weaknesses and to improve its service. Although technological solutions had been used for some years, in 2017 we embarked on an organisation wide E-strategy to address the myriad systems which hindered our service delivery. Using our own internal resources in the main, the organisation continued expanding its use of technology to develop a suite of e-services to eliminate waste, increase efficiency, improve access to justice, reduce delay and support case management.\n",
            "Efforts were spent on among other things:\n",
            "digitisation of records such as probate, court files, pay record cards, accounting records, maintenance cards, human resource management records and correspondence;\n",
            "new case management information systems;\n",
            "remote hearing technology;\n",
            "digital voice writing with audio digital recording;\n",
            "e-payment systems;\n",
            "closed loop email systems between the courts and attorneys;\n",

            "process re-engineering;\n",
            "the Judiciary’s WAN and its cloud\n",
            "While we had been making significant headway, the onslaught of a viral pandemic hurled us onto the speedway of implementation. Our preparation and agility enabled us to immediately put as our driving strategic goals: - Continued Access to Justice; and the Safety of the Public and Our Staff.\n",
            "Several solutions that we had in the works, but for which we had planned a kinder and gentler introduction, were rolled out almost overnight. We asked you to change how you engage with us, and with some understandable concern, you did. We now have full virtual hearings about to be further enhanced by the use of case presentation software. We have payments being made electronically and documents filed online. We have better communication systems and document transmission.\n",
            "Several attorneys commented on the convenience virtual hearings have brought. They are pleased that they can appear at different courts in the country on the same day, reducing the need to ask for adjournments. They appreciate not having the downtime of waiting at a courthouse for their matters to be called; and not having to drive to a location, find parking, walk to the courthouse and wait. Those who have done more full trials have also said that with practice, they are getting the real hang of it. Many attorneys who initially expressed displeasure with the arrangement subsequently indicated their support after participating in virtual hearings. They tried it and they liked it.\n",
            "It has also allowed both lawyers and the public to file documents and make payments without concerns about closing time of court offices or travelling to specific locations. For members of the public without digital resources, provisions were made by kiosks and Virtual Access Customer Centres. It has all brought greater convenience and better access to justice. It has also kept us a bit safer at this unprecedented time.\n",
            "Combined with E-strategies, structural changes also enable us to bring more focused management, improved processes and a better use of resources to the task at hand. We know that for many, no improvement is worthy of recognition until the backlog and delay are reduced and that may mean until their case can be addressed quickly. We recognise this! All of this that we are doing are the building blocks necessary to reduce backlog, by systematically putting the fixes where they are actually needed; not just where anecdotally it is thought to be needed. This is why we need case management Information systems and data and workflow analysis; why we need digitisation and digitalisation, and the right resources, properly managed and assigned. If any of those many moving parts are not properly designed, implemented or managed, your case can be affected. We are addressing the moving parts that WE have responsibility for and trying to work with those agencies and persons who have responsibility for the other parts.\n",
            "So yes, we all have to do things differently. Change is happening fast and we have to be resilient.\n",
            "The President of the UN General Assembly, Volkan Boz-ker has called on us all to increase our resilience. Invariably the fulcrum of resilience includes self-awareness and a sense of purpose, “letting go” or embracing change and connections. These make the difference and allow people, organisations and nations to overcome.\n",

            "Deputy Court Executive Administrator - Family and Children Division\n",
            "This Law Term was testimony to the resilience and dedication of our staff and judicial officers in the Family and Children Division, who despite the many challenges of the Pandemic, steadily pushed ahead to further improve our systems to ensure that our customers continued to have access to the Courts. As problem solving courts, our wraparound services and programmes are critical to the families and children we serve, and these were adapted to the virtual environment. This required staff to hold the hands of our customers through virtual spaces to ensure access. Between the Family and Children Courts over 21,000 virtual social services interventions were conducted.\n",
            "We have also focused on processes to improve how we treat with customers affected by domestic violence, and to provide greater access to the Court, we implemented a Domestic Violence hotline and email system which supported 4,500 customers. Judicial officers, court staff and justice sector partners were also trained in the handling of domestic violence matters. A third Family Court was established in Princes Town and the Family Court in Port of Spain, expanded to ensure families in these jurisdictions receive improved services and access to a Family Court. Together with our colleagues at District Courts we intensified efforts to convert over 9,000 customers to CourtPay to allow easy access to maintenance funds.\n",
            "We have recognised that Children who come before Court lack transitionary support, the Judiciary has therefore developed the A.R.C. (Accelerate, Restore and Connect) Programme and will partner with COSTAATT to provide these Children with opportunities for mentorship, coaching, academic and skills development, and career growth. Electronic Monitoring was also introduced at the Children Court as another non-custodial option for children.\n",
            "This just gives a snapshot of our work, dedication and journey as we continue to provide the necessary support for families and children.\n",
            "The Honourable Mme Justice Ramsumair-Hinds, Judge of the High Court\n",

            "I am Justice Lisa Ramsumair-Hinds.\n",
            "I am Master Trevor Jones. As Partner Master, I case manage the Judge’s calendar robustly. Not every Indictment requires a trial, and I can fast-track matters to the Judge using early disposition tools, such as plea bargaining, guilty pleas to lesser counts and maximum sentence indications. For trials, I narrow the issues to only what is in dispute.\n",
            "Once I get a trial-ready matter, I then manage it to disposition like a project. More persons are electing Judge Alone Trials and have come to realise the efficacy of the virtual courtroom. In Virtual Judge Alone Trials, Attorneys, Accused and anyone else in remote attendance can simultaneously observe every single word and item of evidence together with the fact-finder, who then returns a verdict with reasons.\n",
            "The outlook is even better as we are now using CaseLines for trials.\n",
            "CaseLines is litigation support software that facilitates paperless access to uploaded trial bundles and affords advantages in preparing for and navigating evidence. For example, just imagine, even in a jury trial, the efficiency of an automatic page direction to the relevant photograph or specific time-stamp on CCTV footage.\n",
            "Judges and Masters cannot do it alone. If all stakeholders embrace the virtual reality, as the Rules expect, we can make sensible use of the judicial ear …\n",

            "And a District Court Manager…\n",
            "We represent significant change in the Magistracy. The Magistracy Registrars are newly introduced judicial officers who provide legal services to the court office of the district courts. This has relieved Magistrates from significant administrative responsibilities such as being the keeper of the record and ensuring that court office action is in accord with the law. We have now been able to direct the attention to effective case management and timely disposition of matters.\n",
            "Aside from undertaking these administrative responsibilities, we as Magistracy Registrars are also justices of the peace. We play a pivotal role in ensuring that self-represented litigants are properly guided.\n",
            "As District Court Managers we bring to each court location a level of management that had not before existed. We have therefore been implementing policy, procedures and practices to ensure consistency across the Magistracy and to ensure that consequential activity such as criminal committals, fines and fees administration, as well as records and process management, meet the standards set. We bring human resource management and location management among others to the individual location.\n",
            "Recently the many magistrate court locations were consolidated into three magisterial districts.\n",
            "This provides greater opportunity to consolidate resources, avoid unnecessary duplication and focus the management of our caseload.\n",
            "The advent of Virtual hearings now provide an opportunity to have a single Magistrate hear matters from several locations in a district, thus maximising their effectiveness. These are but a few of the many changes at the District Courts that are designed to help us better serve you.\n",

            "Deputy Court Executive Administrator – Civil Division\n",
            "The Civil Division of the Judiciary includes the Civil High Court, the Probate Registry and the Petty Civil Courts. The Civil Division Administration Department is the administrative arm providing strategic direction for, and oversight of, the Division and its operations.\n",
            "The Law Term has been a year of continuous progress, learning and development. The Division has made strides to becoming a modern, customer-centred environment where court services are delivered in an efficient, effective and accessible manner.\n",
            "During our initial year, the Department facilitated a virtual dialogue session with various stakeholder groups to discuss the establishment of a Small Claims Court. We implemented e-filing portals for the Petty Civil Court and the Probate Registry, and further reworked strategies and processes with a view to promoting value added activity and working towards improved quality services to our customers. I am also pleased to report that development work has started on a new automated case management information system. The TT.jim (Civil) Module will replace outdated software and assist the Division in case management, while contributing to improved statistical reporting.\n",
            "We are certain that these more modern approaches to handling civil matters will redound to the benefit our customers and stakeholders.\n",
            "The learnings from the last year will play a critical role in shaping the way forward for the Division. We will continue to collaborate with stakeholders to encourage the use of alternative methods to resolve civil disputes, among other things. Draft Mediation Rules are currently before the Rules Committee in this regard and infrastructure is in place to guide the process. Probate reform will continue to be a high priority for the Division during the course of the year and we look forward to the introduction of the Small Claims Court in Trinidad and Tobago.\n",
            "In sum, reengineering through process reform, modern approaches to court management and the use of technology will continue to be our focus.\n",
            "We look forward to improving the quality of civil justice and the continued transformation of the Judiciary of Trinidad and Tobago.\n",

            "Accountability for the financial resources entrusted to its care, more specifically the collection of State Revenue, the expenditure of funds appropriated by Parliament for its operation and the Trust Funds it must hold, is also important to the Judiciary.\n",
            "The “CourtPay System”, an integrated electronic court payments solution to receive, disburse and account for all monies paid into and out of court, makes it Simple, Accessible, Fast and Effective and Reliable. With inevitable shutdowns due to the Pandemic our strategic goals became continued access to justice and safety of our customers and our staff. This demanded in the 2021 Law Term the expansion of the CourtPay system to allow all customers to make all payments online. We are pleased that court customers are able to pay a court ordered fine, or a fixed penalty notice, whether it is a public health or mask ticket or a traffic ticket issued prior to May 26 2020, using our online facility with a Credit Card and VISA enabled Debit Card.\n",
            "The Judiciary continues to advocate for the use of CourtPay vouchers for court customers who may not meet the requirements to open and operate bank accounts and therefore must pay in cash. The Ministry of Finance should approve this additional option soon. It is noteworthy that the CourtPay voucher system continues to work successfully for customers making payments for court ordered maintenance since its introduction in April 2018.\n",
            "The Judiciary now collects, reconciles in advance and remits to the Treasury daily via Automated Clearing House (ACH) all State Revenue collected online.\n",
            "The “Electronic Vote Book”, a bespoke contract management, invoice processing and supplier payments system, was fine-tuned and new features develop in the past year. While the automated system operates alongside the established paper based system, we hope to convince the relevant State agencies to approve its use as a replacement for the antiquated, manual, paper based financial management and records keeping system by the end of the 2021 calendar year.\n",
            "The automated financial information management software is fully designed, developed and maintained by our in house Information and Communication Technology staff and is compliant with the public service financial rules and regulations. The system facilitates online processing of statutory and contractual payment obligations, produces on-demand customised reports on these obligations, and alerts the organisation about the financial resources required at specific periods during the financial year.\n",
            "This removes the current limitation of access to paper records during normal working hours. This complimented our work from home strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic. So far we have shared the software with one Government Ministry who was interested in exploring its functionality in the 2022 financial year.\n",

The ICT PMO is currently managing 50 projects which all involve development and/or networking infrastructure and are all, but two, being implemented by Judiciary ICT staff. Those which are being implemented by external persons are being managed by Judiciary staff. Each of these projects are developments geared to improving how we do business and how we serve you.\n",
            "In the modern fast changing world of courts, there are always requests for improvement and enhancement and our staff must be innovative. Following on the philosophy of Frankiwicz and Premuzic, The Department of Court Administration of the Judiciary of Trinidad and Tobago has developed a policy for ICT of nurturing curiosity, harnessing valuable data and having the skills to translate it into meaningful insights, and being able to act on those insights; a policy of pairing technology with the right human skills and investing in adaptability, curiosity and flexibility.\n",

            "The Honourable the Chief Justice, Mr Justice Ivor Archie, O.R.T.T.\n",
            "So there we are ladies and gentlemen! All of this has been accomplished in an environment of restricted movement and declining revenues. Releases for our Development Programme decreased from $45.4 million in fiscal 2020 to $33 million last year. We have been able to sustain significant development and actually utilise funds given to us wisely (we have a burn rate of 97%). I believe the Judiciary has demonstrated its ability to manage public funds in a cost effective, efficient and accountable manner. However, our ability to sustain and accelerate necessary transformations is hampered by the public sector hiring and financing arrangements that are notoriously slow and inefficient and, as I have observed previously, are in some instances incompatible with true judicial independence. I must therefore renew the call for the financial and administrative autonomy promised in the 2015 budget speech. This call goes as far back as 1892, for our colonial forebears had established a Commission to look into the functioning of the Registrar’s Office in Trinidad, this was the fulcrum on which the Judiciary operated, and it was concluded that the Registry should have been a closed shop given the special requirements such as skill sets and the need to retain these skill sets. Nothing has changed since then, indeed it has grown worse in the Judiciary in respect of our freedom to manage our own affairs. The skill sets necessary for optimal functioning in a judicial environment are often unique and cannot be acquired elsewhere in state employment or (in areas like IT) in a formal degree program. The fact is that, internationally, education is moving more towards modular, buffet style accretion of skills as job markets and typical career structures evolve. The focus on ‘papers’ rather than competencies, means that I couldn’t hire Bill Gates as an IT technician. Criteria for hiring contract workers in the Public Sector unfairly discounts private sector experience. We must do better than that! It takes way too long to hire anybody in the public sector. The approach being adopted by the CPO clearly hampers our ability to retain the necessary agility and flexibility to execute our transformation and ongoing mandate. It builds in inefficiencies, does not allow managers to manage, and pays no attention to the fact that the judiciary is a separate arm of state with a different need, approach and structure. . We cannot transform a nation by digitising archaic processes and adding layers of control. To be clear, the judiciary is not merely engaged in a process of digitisation (which is converting data from analogue to digital form with no process reform). We are engaged in a process of digitalisation which is leveraging digital enablement to transform our business model and seize value-producing opportunities. If that distinction is internalised across the public sector there would be a quantum leap in productivity.\n",
            "In that regard, there are some major transformations in store for this year. We begin with the establishment of the Estates Administration office to replace the Probate Registry within the Civil Division of the Supreme Court. This will entail a revision of internal processes and staffing assisted by the online authentication of Court Documents. Online authentication, or e-verification will extend beyond probate to all court orders and office copies.\n",
            "Another major focus will be the promised small claims court where we intend to explore online dispute resolution.\n",
            "I am pleased to announce that despite challenges faced by cash flow and COVID-19, the move to Tower D at the International Waterfront has begun and some departments are already installed. The movement of the Civil Division of the Supreme Court, including the Court of Appeal will enable roll-out of technology enabled courtrooms and incorporation of alternative dispute resolution.\n",
            "We will continue the expansion of e-payments, including vouchers to cover all fines and fees and, together with the profession via the Rules Committee we propose to simplify the fee structure to avoid multiple filing fees for each case.\n",
            "I have noted the backlog of sexual offence cases and the particular effect that delay, as well as the standard processes and procedures have on victims. Since legislative provision has already been made for the Rules Committee to create special procedures for case-types selected by the Chief Justice a committee has been convened to draft procedures for the attention of the Rules Committee. We intend to bring a sexual offences court into operation.\n",
            "We will not be neglecting general backlog in civil and criminal matters and separate committees are being convened for each division.\n",
            "I am pleased to see that we have begun to get more indictments from the DPP’s office and, now that the Hon. Attorney General has announced the switch over date for elimination of preliminary inquiries we look forward to working closely with the DPP and the public and private defence bar to achieve a smooth transition. The numbers won’t be less but it is a fantastic opportunity to retool our process with an open mind. Now that we have more experience and data concerning judge alone trials, the time is ripe for further discussion about making that a more robust (perhaps even the default) option, without eliminating choice as appropriate.\n",
            "I want to pay a special tribute to our staff and judicial officers, many of whom worked impossible hours to make all of this possible. It could not have happened without their extraordinary dedication and commitment. A special tribute is due to our unsung heroes, the medical response team who kept us going and worked proactively, despite the tragic loss of two staff members to COVID-19, to keep us and our buildings safe. We can never repay them.\n",
            "There is more, much much more, but we only have so much time today. I invite you to go online and look at our website to get a fuller appreciation of what is being accomplished and the continuing enhancement of service. For those of you interested in detailed statistics, our annual report, due before the end of the calendar year and which will also be available online will be a useful resource.\n",
            "Of course, none of this could have or will be accomplished without the invaluable input of our dedicated team and our external stakeholders, some of whom have already been mentioned. Lists are always dangerous so I will say a general and heartfelt thank you to all. Most of all, to you my fellow citizens, thank you for being patient with us as we strive to manage major transformation during this ongoing pandemic and for having afforded me the courtesy of your attention today.

            "I rise to present Government’s Estimates of Revenues and Expenditure for the Fiscal Year 2022/2023, and to report on the performance of the National Budget for the current Fiscal Year 2021/2022.\n",
            "What has been achieved in our first budget year is truly remarkable.\n",
            "Across the land, a new day is dawning, the economy is bouncing back, Belizeans are returning to work in larger numbers than ever before, the Belize dollar is strong again, default and devaluation have been averted and the confidence of the State and those she serves is being restored.\n",
            "Today, with pride, I will share a progress report unmatched in our 41 years as an independent nation. The storyline is of a macroeconomic and fiscal house on fire when we took office less than 16 months ago, transformed now to a house whose rehabilitation is outclassing its regional peers and overshooting expectations.\n",
            "I remind this Assembly of what our Administration inherited. An economy weighed down by corruption and incompetence, withering from prolonged recession, battered by COVID-19 lockdowns, strangled by rocketing debt and deficits, squeezed by costly credit, beset with surging unemployment, and bereft of self-belief and common-sense solutions.\n",
            "Belize’s 2021 national economic rebound may be as high as 12.5 percent according to the IMF, twice the rate of the Latin America and Caribbean regions. In fact, save for Guyana and its crude oil bonanza, Belize is the fastest growing economy amongst all countries in North, Central and South America and the Caribbean. Our overall budget performance for this fiscal year will be $527 million better than the last fiscal year. The country’s 174 thousand-strong employed labour force is the highest ever. A well-capitalized banking system brims with almost $700 million of liquidity, poised to fund a private sector boom. Public debt is being slashed with precedent-setting ingenuity. And, 4.6 months of import cover in Central Bank reserves buttress the Belize dollar.\n",
            "My report today will show that our first Budget exceeded all performance markers and that the new Budget, proposed at $1.361 billion, will be the largest spending and investment Budget in the history of our country. And we have managed to prudently and responsibly configure this new Budget with a primary surplus.\n",
            "These are remarkable achievements which properly belong to all Belizeans, and particularly result from Government’s vibrant partnership with commerce and industry; its collaboration with public sector employees and their larger number in the private sector; and its cooperation with Belize’s unique network of developmental NGOs.\n",
            "I acknowledge not only the positive evolution of these crucial domestic alliances but also, the rapid re-setting of relations with our Official Sector and bilateral supporters. The pipeline of project funding, the envelope of grant financing is more generous, more diverse than ever before. Our international partners, like investors, can see clearly that this Administration is focused, determined to nurture an equitable prosperity, and committed to the highest standards of governance.\n",
            "To say it plain, Madam Speaker, we have put our house in order, strengthen the state of the nation, restored our reputation in the region and we are indeed delivering on Plan Belize.\n",
            "The Regional and Domestic Context\n",
            "The global economy recovered markedly from the adverse effects of COVID-19 in 2021. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected that world output would increase by 5.9 percent in 2021, following a deep 3.1 percent contraction in 2020. Nevertheless, the global growth momentum faced stiff headwinds along the way. Economies worldwide were hit hard by (i) the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, (ii) pandemic outbreaks and weather disruptions that led to major supply disruptions in the production and movement of goods, and (iii) rising food and energy prices triggered by the intensification of global imbalances. On average, advanced economies reportedly grew by 5.2 percent, while emerging and developing countries expanded faster by 6.4 percent in 2021.\n",
            "Among major advanced economies, the real gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States (U.S.) increased by 5.7 percent in the previous year.\n",
            "Closer to home, the Latin America and the Caribbean region posted a 6.3 percent rebound for the year. Economies in Central America grew by 5.5 percent in 2021 after contracting 6.0 percent in 2020. The upswing occurred against a backdrop of heightened commodity prices alongside historical levels of remittances, which provided significant support to households during a time of severe hardship. According to the World Bank, remittance inflows to Latin America and the Caribbean increased by 21.6 percent in 2021 and likely surpassed the sum of foreign direct investment and overseas development assistance to the region.\n",
            "The easing of health restrictions and higher vaccination rates amid new COVID-19 variants in major source markets anchored growth in the region. Positive economic growth was recorded in all Central America. Nicaragua had the lowest output in Central America at 2.5 percent, while El Salvador and Panama witnessed robust growth rates of 7.5 percent and 12.0 percent, respectively. Mexico’s economy grew by 6.2 percent, stimulated by agricultural and manufactured exports and was the principal source of record-high remittance inflows.\n",
            "In the Caribbean region, the Caribbean Development Bank estimated that Caribbean economies grew by 3.0 percent in 2021. Like in the other geographical areas, the nascent recovery among states was uneven. Service-exporting economies reportedly grew by 3.2 percent, slightly faster than commodity exporters’ 2.7 percent growth pace. Service economies rebounded gradually from the pick-up in international travel which, in turn, fueled domestic consumption as vaccination rollouts became more widespread, border restrictions were relaxed, and lockdown measures eased.\n",
            "Underpinned by an upsurge in oil production, Guyana’s economy expanded by roughly 20.0 percent. However, the economies of Trinidad and Tobago and Suriname both recorded modest contractions, emanating from the commodity sectors of their respective nations.\n",
            "The Belize Context\n",
            "Real Sector Developments\n",
            "According to recent estimates by the IMF, Belize’s economy expanded by 12.5 percent in 2021 relative to 2020. The SIB’s preliminary number is just below 10 percent. This impressive performance follows a 16.7 percent decline the year before when the country faced severe pandemic-related economic losses, marking one of the most significant GDP swings since independence and among service-based economies within this region. Let us not forget that since 2019, the Belizean economy was already in recession. More so considering the economy was already mired in a prolonged recession prior to the Coronavirus pandemic.\n",
            "According to the Central Bank of Belize, the reasons for the spectacular 2021 GDP growth achievement, were (i) the timely reopening of the economy, (ii) a strong vaccination campaign, and (iii) a resurgence in agricultural production from weather-related shocks, each of these being deliberate policies pursued by Government.\n",
            "Output in the primary sector of the economy expanded robustly. This sector grew by 11.2 percent, with significant contributions from the agriculture and livestock industries and fishing to a lesser extent. Agricultural output soared, as banana production rebounded strongly from the wake of Hurricane Nana in September 2020 to a new seven-year high. Sugarcane deliveries to processors in the north and west reached an all-time high with increased investments in new commercial production acreage for the latter. Livestock output grew, as cattle exports to Mexico and Guatemala doubled after lifting trade restrictions in late 2020. Poultry and pork production strengthened firmly in tandem with the recovery in domestic consumption. In the fisheries sub-sector, increased lobster, and conch hauls more than compensated for the reduction in farmed shrimp output, which continued to be challenged by the devastating effects of the Early Mortality Syndrome.\n",
            "I commend Minister Abelardo Mai and his team for their superlative work during this year. In such a short period of time, they have managed to reverse the persistent decline in a sector that was abandoned and stymied under the previous Administration.\n",
            "Production in the secondary sector contracted slightly by 1.2 percent, as a steep contraction in electricity generation weighed down value-added gains from food manufacturing and construction activities. Positively, manufacturing activity grew by 5.7 percent, with notable contributions from the sugar and beverage industries. The resumption of major private and public capital projects led to a substantial 15.1 percent expansion in construction activities. However, these improvements were eclipsed by an 18.2 percent dip in electricity and water supply output.\n",
            "The services sector grew by 10.1 percent reversing a devastating negative growth of 20.2 percent in 2020. This spectacular outcome was because of the recovery in the overnight tourism, following the opening of the Philip Goldson International Airport in mid-2020. Stay-over arrivals increased by 58.9 percent in 2021 generating positive spin-off effects in the tourism and travel related sub-sectors. Cruise line services, which started in July 2021, led to 200,000 cruise passengers coming ashore to visit our destinations. Lastly, the increase in local spending boosted trade in the wholesale and retail distribution sectors by 22 percent while Government expenditure cuts to reduce fiscal deficits caused a 14.7 percent decline in Government services.\n",
            "Employment\n",
            "According to the Central Bank, job opportunities improved amid pandemic-related disruptions and Government’s myriad efforts to drive up employment opportunities. The unemployment rate fell to 9.2 percent in September 2021, which was 4.5 percentage points better than a year ago. This outcome resulted as the number of people who gained employment outpaced the number of additional people seeking work. Between September 2021 and April 2021, the number of unemployed persons fell by 13.2 percent facilitated by the robust turnaround in economic performance. Employment growth was concentrated among service industries, many of which experienced severe economic dislocation during the early part of the crisis. Accordingly, the service sector registered a 16.5 percent increase in new hiring over the six-month period with most of the new employment opportunities recorded in the tourism, distributive trade, and real estate industries. Meanwhile, the labour force participation rate rose by 2.2 percentage points to 61.9 percent, as many of the displaced individuals sought to re-join the labour force, spurred by the resumption in many business activities.\n",
            "But this was not the only reason for the job improvement situation, Madam Speaker. The ingenuity of the Belizean people also gave rise to a new form of self-employment as numerous Belizeans started a myriad of small jobs from designer face masks to food delivery; from online retail design services to new forms of internet entertainment in music, comedy to other forms of performance art.\n",
            "The External Sector\n",
            "Turning to the external sector, the external current account deficit on the balance of payments for the first nine months of 2021 widened slightly. The deficit edged up by merely 0.1 percentage point of GDP to 3.8 percent of GDP, or $127.3 million. For sure there was a strong growth in imports, however, this was offset by the growth in tourism revenue, other service export receipts, and inward remittances. Merchandise imports rose on account of three factors:\n",
            "heightened demand for goods to support the economic recovery,\n",
            "increased costs of goods in source countries, precipitated by escalating global inflation rates, and\n",
            "rising international shipping costs, exacerbated by supply disruptions abroad.\n",
            "Net financial inflows exceeded $200.0 million and included an extraordinary $72.6 million allocation of Special Drawing Rights from the IMF in August 2021 to supplement the country’s reserves.\n",
            "The initiative by the IMF was essentially to help countries build resilience to balance of payments shocks and ensure a sustainable recovery in the aftermath of the pandemic.\n",
            "By year end, Belize’s gross official international reserves had increased by $132.2 million to $830.0 million, equivalent to 4.6 months of import coverage.\n",
            "Monetary and Financial Sector Developments\n",
            "Dynamics within the monetary and financial system development were also shaped by effects of the pandemic and the recession we inherited. Broad money supply grew rapidly, accelerating by 12.3 percent in 2021, the fastest growth pace on record since 2008. According to the Central Bank, this outcome was driven by a sharp upturn in net foreign assets of the banking system, which reached $1.4bn at year-end. Almost two-thirds of the $444.2 million increase in net foreign balances was due to a doubling in domestic banks’ holdings to a year-end high of $596.5 million.\n",
            "This unprecedented growth in domestic banks’ foreign asset balances underscored: (i) the rebound in tourism revenue, (ii) a boom in call centre receipts, (iii) a surge in remittance inflows, (iv) a surge in direct foreign investment, and (v) a resurgence in Corozal Free Zone sales, following the reopening of storefronts on 1 February 2021. I stress that each of the growth factors for this unprecedented increase in the foreign holdings of the commercial banks is the handiwork of our administration.\n",
            "Furthermore, in response to the unprecedented economic shock, the Central Bank and domestic banks implemented stricter controls on foreign currency usage to enhance banks’ shock-absorbing capacity and minimize risks to the monetary and financial system. In addition to the boom at domestic banks, the Central Bank’s net foreign assets expanded by $148.5 million in 2021. For the second consecutive year, the monetary authority’s foreign asset position registered an increase in reserves that exceeded $140.0 million.\n",
            "The next major component of money supply, net domestic credit, grew at a much more modest pace against the backdrop of the ongoing crisis and new fiscal consolidation efforts. Net domestic credit expanded by 0.2 percent in 2021 when compared to the year before. This marginal uptick in credit resulted as bank lending to the real economy moderated, while the Government’s borrowings from the banking system declined in an effort to widen its fiscal space. Encouragingly, domestic bank lending to the private sector increased by $43.6 million in 2021, down slightly from $47.4 million in 2020. New loans to support the economic recovery were channeled mainly to the tourism, construction, and agricultural sectors. Domestic bank forbearance measures to reduce borrowers’ debt service costs amid the economic fallout continued throughout the year. In 2021, domestic banks granted creditors $151.0 million in additional loan forbearances, raising the total of forbearances granted through this prudential policy measure to $858.5 million since the onset of the pandemic.\n",
            "Domestic bank liquidity expanded further in 2021. Boosted by the foreign asset expansion, excess liquidity rose by $230.6 million to $698.3 million, while excess cash reserves strengthened by $63.8 million to $415.6 million in 2021. Borrowing costs inched up marginally as credit conditions tightened, and as expected during any prolonged period of severe economic shock. In 2021, the weighted average lending rate rose by 13 basis points on account of marginal rate hikes in personal, residential construction, and other miscellaneous loan categories. Furthermore, the skewed liquidity distribution contributed to a two-basis point lift in the weighted average deposit rate to 2.05 percent. As a result, the weighted average interest rate spread widened by 11 basis points for the year.\n",
            "Recall the prediction by the previous Prime Minister when he proclaimed to the nation that he wept for Belize in fear of devaluation. Due mainly I must say to he and his government irresponsible spending plan which was that they would borrow until they could borrow no more.\n",
            "You see madam speaker there is a huge difference between the incipience of their administration who had so much and did so little and our administration who did so much with so little. Imagine what we would have done for our nation with the hundreds of millions in oil revenues and what they called the Petro Caribe Bonanza. What we have done in our short term in office to restore confidence in our monetary system and in strengthening the Belizean dollar is in stark contrast to what they did to put our financial system in peril.\n",
            "Economic Prospects for 2022\n",
            "The global growth momentum observed in 2021 is expected to recede in 2022. According to the IMF, global growth is expected to weaken by 1.5 percentage points to 4.4 percent in 2022. Economies worldwide will be challenged to improve the welfare of their citizens while facing: (i) disruptions caused by new COVID-19 variants, (ii) high inflation stimulated by ongoing supply chain disruptions and escalating food and energy prices, (iii) withdrawals of extraordinary monetary and fiscal stimulus, implemented to mitigate the economic fallout, (iv) rising geopolitical hostilities with significant negative spillovers across the world, (v) large debt overhangs exacerbated by the crisis, and (vi) adverse weather events.\n",
            "This crisis and the ongoing recovery are unprecedented. Like in the rest of the global community, Belize’s growth pace is projected to moderate in the upcoming year, following the strong rebound in 2021. The Central Bank of Belize projects that the country’s GDP will likely expand around 6.0 percent in 2022, the IMF’s projection is 6.5 percent growth. The projected output largely reflects a slowdown in the growth of agricultural production as the boost from weather-related improvements the year before dissipates, and the upturn in tourist arrivals tempers given the solid outturn recorded last year.\n",
            "Fiscal Year 2021/2022 PERFORMANCE\n",
            "Madam Speaker,\n",
            "The projected performance for Fiscal Year 2021/22 is nothing short of spectacular, in terms of the overall Budget outturn, and especially in terms of revenue resilience.\n",
            "On the revenue front, total Recurrent Revenue is projected at $1.048 billion, which, when added to $50m in grants and $5.36 million in capital revenues, produce Total Revenue and Grants of $1.192 billion. This performance is 19 percent or $194m higher than the budgeted number and therefore almost double the rate of GDP expansion for 2021.\n",
            "All four broad categories of Tax Revenues recorded increases, with taxes on International Trade and Transactions and Taxes on Goods and Services were the star performers, exceeding budgeted levels by 27 percent and 24 percent, respectively.\n",
            "Non-Tax Revenue exceeded the budgeted amount by about $7 million or 9 percent.\n",
            "The exceptional Grants funding line of $50m is almost entirely the result of the immense generosity of the people and Government of the Republic of China Taiwan. In my recent visit to Taipei, accompanied by various Members of the Cabinet, I had the opportunity to express the enduring gratitude of the Government and people of Belize for the imperishable fraternity shared by our two nations.\n",
            "On the expenditure side, total spending is projected at $1.217 billion, or $14 million higher than budgeted. Recurrent Expenditure exceeded Budget limits in 4 of 5 categories. In the case of Wages and Pensions, the excess was by 2 percent of the budgeted levels. In the case of debt service, the $19 million in projected additional spending represents the first Blue Bond payments and is a fraction of the debt service payments foregone for the previous two Budget cycles.\n",
            "Now the excess spending in the instance of Goods and Services is the item of greatest concern to me: $50m or some 29 percent higher than the Budget. While we concede that the cut for FY 2021/22 was significant, compared to previous years, there must be an acceptance that spending 20 cents of every dollar collected by Government on Goods & Services is intolerably high.\n",
            "The Ministry of Finance will redouble efforts to suppress this expenditure line item but to do so requires an all-of-government approach. I appeal to Ministries and Financial Officers to exercise maximum restraint.\n",
            "Capital spending is projected to total $243 million, about 19 percent less than budgeted levels, this being attributable to the uneven implementation schedule for certain capital projects, especially for drawing down on Capital III funding lines.\n",
            "At the bottom line, this Budget’s Primary balance will be $197 million or 5.71 percent of GDP better than forecasted and the Overall Budget Balance, $179 million or 5.37 percent of GDP better than forecasted.\n",
            "Finally, in this fiscal year, Government expects to retire $86.4 million in public debt, separate and apart from the write-offs related to the Super Bond discounted buyout. Based on revenue and spending performance, Government’s total borrowing for this Budget is now projected at $112.1 million, which is $211 million less than the $323.8 million approved by the National Assembly.\n",
            "PUBLIC DEBT\n",
            "Turning to the management and trajectory of the public debt, Madam Speaker, my Administration is unmatched.\n",
            "We promised to resolve, once and for all, the Super Bond quagmire and we delivered in our first year in office.\n",
            "Since October of last year, when this Honorable House endorsed the Blue Bond for Conservation initiative, Belize has been the toast of the sustainable finance universe, heralded for the innovation and boldness of a transaction that achieved three simultaneous objectives:\n",
            "first, reduction of our public indebtedness by over half a billion dollars or 45 percent of the value of the Super Bond;\n",
            "second, a renewed commitment to marine conservation, including, protecting 30 percent of our ocean space;\n",
            "and third, establishing a reliable, multi-generational, marine conservation funding mechanism valued in the hundreds of millions.\n",
            "At the COP 26 Conference in Glasgow, Scotland last November, and in the days since, Belize’s debt restructuring model has provided a template for sovereign debt workouts that address humanity’s climate crisis, with countries like Sri Lanka, Ecuador, Argentina, Bolivia, among others following suit in some form or the other.\n",
            "According to the IMF’s most recent assessment, issued on 24th February 2022, Belize’s public debt fell from 133 percent of GDP at the close of 2020 to 108 percent at the close of 2021, down by a massive 25 percent of GDP.\n",
            "I quote: “Significant progress towards restoring debt sustainability was made in 2021.”\n",
            "That is the independent judgment of the IMF Staff on this Government’s debt management performance. Just a year ago, Belize was labeled a serial defaulter, facing the very real prospect of a painful IMF Program and possible currency devaluation. A year later, optimism abounds that Belize has opened an exciting new chapter:\n",
            "the currency peg rescued,\n",
            "the reserves robust, its reputation transformed with the emergence of Brand Belize as a leading climate-conscious nation, and the future flush with immense potential.\n",
            "In dollar terms, when 2020 ended, Belize owed over $4.2 billion dollars, a debt stock that has now been reduced to just under $4 billion just one year later.\n",
            "Of what Belize currently owes, external debt totals BZ$ 2.7 billion or some 72 percent of 2021 GDP while 36 percent of GDP or some BZ$ 1.3 billion is owed to domestic creditors.\n",
            "Apart from resolving the Super Bond, I wish to highlight three other major debt management achievements in 2021:\n",
            "First, during this Fiscal Year, Government paid off over $90 million in Overdraft advances previously held with the Central Bank, eliminating the interest expense on that debt.\n",
            "Second, for the first time since 2014, when the domestic debt stood at $376 million, Government domestic debt balance was reduced. Let me underline this point: in the seven years, between 2014 and 2020, the previous Administration borrowed one billion dollars from domestic sources alone, a jaw-dropping average of $143m per year ($2.75 Million per week). In 2021, my Administration reduced the outstanding domestic debt by $59.2 million.\n",
            "And third, the Ministry of Finance commissioned, for the first time, a comprehensive assessment of domestic debt, with the objective of reducing Government’s cost of borrowing which currently stands at an average coupon rate of 3.3 percent. Based on this analysis, through market-based yield curve management, a phased re-pricing for new issues of both Treasury Bills and Notes should gradually lower interest payments on the domestic debt stock while at the same time lowering the benchmark for interest rates for the entire financial system thereby incentivizing lending and economic activity.\n",
            "For the new Fiscal Year, interest payments on the public debt are expected to rise by BZD 24.1 million, from $87.8 million to $111.9 million. For two years, Belize made no payments on external commercial debt, capitalizing this obligation in 2020 and including interest accrued in the Super Bond settlement last year. Blue Bond-related payments commenced in 2022. Even so, interest payments represent only 9 cents of every recurrent revenue dollar and even less – 8 cents – of every dollar spent. And our medium-term forecast suggests that debt service payments will remain at this manageable level: below 10 cents per recurrent revenue dollar for the ensuing 4-year horizon.\n",
            "Now, let’s be clear. The public debt emergency is not over. Servicing a public debt of $3.9 billion is a heavy burden which directs funds away from people-centered priorities such as education, sports, health, housing, and citizen security. Virtually half of the $4.2 billion debt load accrued before our debt reduction efforts was accumulated during the 13 years of the UDP.\n",
            "This PUP Administration cannot undo 13 years of UDP mismanagement and corruption in a single year.\n",
            "But I reiterate our firm target for a debt to GDP ratio of 85 percent by Fiscal Year 2025/26 and 70 percent by 2030/31.\n",
            "ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN 2020/2021\n",
            "Due to our fiscal performance in 2020/2021 and even as we worked to put our financial house in order, we did not fail to deliver on Plan Belize.\n",
            "Provisional data reveal that 1.535 new businesses were established in 2021 many of them by young entrepreneurs. This may be as a result of the financing that Government made available for MSMEs through the National Bank of Belize and the Development Finance Cooperation, which targeted mainly women and young people.\n",
            "The Belize Investment Summit held November 10th and 11th 2021, a first of its kind event, focused on attracting and promoting investment for economic development in Belize. This high-profile occasion was led by the Office of the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Investment under the theme: “Belize is Open for Business”. This was a call to both local and international investors for identifying opportunities and for the government to showcase Belize’s readiness to support global investment through vastly improved service delivery.\n",
            "Our country boasts exceptional and untapped growth potential and having a wealth of opportunities in areas, such as Agriculture, Tourism, Blue Economy, Business Process Outsourcing, Manufacturing and Renewable Energy these were highlighted at our first Investment Summit. Coupled with the great success of the Blue Bond, the limitless opportunities in the green and blue economies garnered great interest and excitement among investors.\n",
            "As Prime Minister, I am convinced that the Summit was done at the opportune time to invite investors to Belize. It was an opportunity for foreign and local investors to establish strategic partnerships and find investment opportunities. Post the Belize Investment Summit we are now starting to experience the tangible benefits of increased investment in our economy.\n",
            "As it relates to the coronavirus, our vaccine rollout was robust and close to 50 percent of our population has been fully vaccinated. I appeal again to those not yet vaccinated to please do so, vaccines save lives and is the only way we will defeat COVID.\n",
            "You have all seen the many thousands of Belizeans who have benefitted from the outreach program instituted across towns and villages. Our Deputy Prime Minister and his team at the Ministry of Natural Resources, Petroleum and Mining have been determined and diligent in taking the Lands Department to the people, wherever they are. In cities, towns and far-flung villages – as far south as Bella Vista and Punta Gorda, and as far north as San Joaquin and Corozal Town, last year alone 8 Land Mobile Clinics brought Belmopan to thousands of Belizeans who have otherwise been stymied and denied the services of the Lands Department over the previous 13 years.\n",
            "As a result of their efforts, more than 7,895 leases, grants and purchase approvals to ordinary Belizeans ─ including teachers, nurses, soldiers, police officers, single mothers and fathers, the employed and unemployed, and students and the elderly ─ were distributed. This coming year the Ministry of Natural Resources is committing to issuing another 8,000 lots to first-time landowners. We are budgeting a $1 million for the survey of additional lots in every district of this beautiful country of ours.\n",
            "In infrastructure development, rural roads have undergone improvements, our highways and bridges continue to be rehabilitated and plans for road and highway expansion are in the works.\n",
            "After years and years of talk by the UDP, the long-awaited Haulover Bridge Construction Project has commenced at a price tag of close to 20 million dollars less than was budgeted for by the previous administration, free from hustle and political cronyism.\n",
            "In our first year alone, over 167 houses have been built for single mothers and first-time homeowners. Good homes that will last for generations and will help to lift those 167 families out of poverty and restore dignity to their lives.\n",
            "Millions of dollars were issued in scholarships, not to political cronies, but to deserving Belizean students. This compliments the many international scholarships for our deserving students in countries like Taiwan, Cuba, Mexico, the U.S., Europe and South America.\n",
            "And Madam Speaker we have restored Belize’s reputation internationally. Through the efforts of our foreign ministry, we have begun our work of active participation at the UN and the OAS, in regional organizations Belize is once again seated at the table in CARICOM and SICA. Our recent CARICOM Summit and our CARICOM/SICA Summit, which had the participation of the UN Secretary-General, is setting the pace for Belize enhancing its role as the bridge between Central America and the Caribbean.\n",
            "As it relates to our efforts at success in bringing a final and definitive end to the long-standing claim by Guatemala over our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we are well on pace to present our response to Guatemala’s claim now at the ICJ.\n",
            "This is but a fraction of the work we have done in delivering on our promise to the people and we have only just begun.\n",
            "As it relates to our reform agenda, we established a reformed Public Accounts Committee and I urge Chairman Tracy Panton the member for Albert to get on with the work of this important committee.\n",
            "In the Attorney General’s Ministry, much has been done in the improvement of our judicial and legal services:\n",
            "We now have two virtual courtrooms.\n",
            "A law library has been established at the Attorney General’s Ministry. Through the generous assistance of Belize Electricity Limited, important law books and treaties have been acquired so that our crown counsels can be fully prepared to argue in our courts.\n",
            "We produced the 2020 Revised Laws of Belize, which is an update from the 2011 Revised Edition.\n",
            "An informative website is now being provided with information about the services of the ministry including free access to the 2020 Revised Laws of Belize.\n",
            "We have expanded the current units to create a Legal Advice Unit set up to provide full-time access to government offices for legal advice.\n",
            "Additional staff has been provided in Legislative Drafting Unit and in the Litigation Unit.\n",
            "Specialized training is being provided to the Crown Counsels in the Legislative Drafting Unit.\n",
            "We are expanding Legal Aid with human resources, to expand firstly to Corozal and thereafter to the West and Southern Belize.\n",
            "With the assistance of Impact Justice, we are in the process of revising the Subsidiary Laws of Belize, which has not been revised for some 19 years.\n",
            "We are restructuring the upper courts and in due course will be tabling the Senior Courts Bill.\n",
            "We have appointed three Justices of Appeal to the Court of Appeal, with two more scheduled to be appointed in June 2022 and acquired four judges for the Supreme Court, to clear backlog.\n",
            "We have appointed four new magistrates, acquired software to facilitate the online filing of court documents for Court of Appeal and for the Supreme Court, acquired hardware to enable virtual court hearings for the criminal division and to facilitate witness testimony from the Kolbe Foundation. Soon we will be introducing new rules for the Family and Probate Division of the Supreme Court to modernize the practice in these courts.\n",
            "All this in partial fulfilment of our Plan Belize promise to deliver affordable access and speedier trials and restoring the independence of the judiciary.\n",
            "During the budget debate my colleagues will expand on this list of accomplishments that were made in 2021.\n",
            "Fiscal Year 2022/2023: THE NEW BUDGET\n",
            "Summary Estimates for 2022//2023\n",
            "Madam Speaker,\n",
            "Belize is a small, open and therefore fragile economy. So many of the factors that determine our fiscal fortunes are beyond our control. These factors include inflation, interest rates, the cost of fuel and energy, climate change, the terms for trade and commerce, to mention just a few. In assembling the Budget for Fiscal Year 2022/23, not only have these factors weighed heavily upon our considerations but another concern stood foremost in our collective thinking: the fragility of our economic and fiscal recovery from devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
            "From both a revenue and spending standpoint, Government must be cautious. Therefore, there is no new, major tax revenue measure in this Budget. Yes, we will seek to close certain tax loopholes, to adjust collections for activities such as in the lotteries sector, that are not fairly contributing, and to aggressively enforce the current revenue mandate.\n",
            "On the spending side, the new Budget restores the wage levels of FY 2020/21 to public officers and teachers, maintains fairly even other recurrent spending lines and re-prioritizes capital investments to align with several major social justice goals of the Plan Belize Blueprint.\n",
            "Details for the Budget for Fiscal Year 2022/23\n",
            "Recurrent Revenues are projected at $1.122 billion, which is 7.5 percent or $86 million higher than the forecasted outturn for this fiscal year. Both Tax and Non-Tax revenues are projected to rise while Capital Revenues will remain constant, and Grants will fall to $35 million, in line with our bilateral agreements.\n",
            "Revenue growth is consistent with the 6.5 percent overall GDP growth forecast of the IMF for 2022 and the Central Bank’s slightly more modest 6 percent growth forecast.\n",
            "On the Expenditure side, overall spending will rise compared to this year’s projected outturn by $144 million or 12 percent. These increases include the following major spending lines:\n",
            "Ø Wages and Pensions will rise by a combined 10 percent, or some $49 million, most of this attributable to the 10 percent wage restoration which is to commence on July first.\n",
            "Ø Subsidies and Transfers will rise by $37 million, or 25 percent, which is mostly indirect wage subsidies linked to the wage restoration.\n",
            "Ø Debt service will rise by $24 million, as we commence interest payments on the Blue Bonds.\n",
            "Ø Capital Spending will rise by $30 million compared to this year’s outturn of $243 million.\n",
            "I will address in more detail the issues of wages, pensions, and capital spending priorities.\n",
            "In summary, therefore, the new Budget targets a Primary Surplus of some $14 million, or 0.35 percent of GDP, along with an overall deficit of $98.1 million or 2.49 percent of GDP.\n",
            "Government proposes to retire $97.4 million in public debt during this budget cycle. Total financing required for this Budget Year will be $195.6 million, to be sourced from the following lenders:\n",
            "$84 million from Taiwan, being a portion of a $150 million loan in pursuance of our MOU with them, and\n",
            "$98 million disbursements from International Financial Institutions in support of our Capital II Program; and $13 million from the domestic system financed through new issue of Government treasury securities.\n",
            "Outside these academic numbers, which must be recited for consistency, I punctuate, with just a few examples what this Budget does for all Belizeans:\n",
            "Ø It employs 15,000 public officers and teachers who collectively provide 35.1 million work hours of public service during the Budget period;\n",
            "Ø The Budget underwrites national sovereignty and citizen security through the roles of the Belize Defence Force, the Belize Police Department and the Coast Guard;\n",
            "Ø The Budget funds the functioning of the Judiciary, thereby providing the mechanisms for law and order in our country;\n",
            "Ø The Budget pays for 181 Government schools, contributes to another 381 grant-aided schools, supports some level of direct scholarship funding for 4,000 students at the tertiary level and effectively bankrolls the national education system, from kinder to UB for 102,679 students; and this Budget will provide an additional $2 million for Youth and Sporting Programs.\n",
            "Ø Our National Referral Hospital, regional hospitals and clinics, and the entire public health system is subsidized by this Budget;\n",
            "Ø The Budget funds the national infrastructure system, maintaining 527 miles of paved roads, 2,294 of gravel surface roads, 300 bridges, not to mention the entirety of new infrastructure projects;\n",
            "Ø Rural development, the land registry and land surveys, the provision of passports, the facilitation of trade and investments, the regulation of every sector from tourism to aviation to agriculture is, to some degree, subsidized by the national Budget.\n",
            "Whether you live, go to school or work in any of our two cities, seven towns or almost 200 villages, this Budget touches your life positively in some way or another.\n",
            "What distinguishes this new Budget, and the current one, is the extent to which my Administration strives to collect the people’s revenues, strives to secure value for money in spending and strives to ensure that in the main, the People’s Budget is an instrument for equitable national development and prosperity.\n",
            "IMPACTS OF the NEW BUDGET\n",
            "Madam Speaker,\n",
            "To address our principled priorities, I wish to outline just a few of the pertinent capital spending targets that will be enabled by this Budget, first with those that are funded from external loan and grant resources – the so-called Capital III Program:\n",
            "$4.0 million for continuation of the Strengthening of Tax Administration and for the full rollout of the IRIS (Integrated Revenue Information Systems), a multi-year program supported by the IDB.\n",
            "$1.0 million for the Strengthening of Public Expenditure Management, also supported by the IDB.\n",
            "$13.5 million to the Education Sector to improve access, equity and quality in our all-important Education System, supported jointly by the IDB and CDB.\n",
            "$2.0 million of additional funds for the COVID -19 response – for purchase and administration of the Vaccine program, this supported by the World Bank.\n",
            "$1.5 million for the new Climate Resilient and Sustainable Agriculture Program (CRESAP) to be funded by the World Bank.\n",
            "$3.5 million for the Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building in our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade, and Immigration, this support provided by the Government of the Republic of China on Taiwan.\n",
            "$1.5 million for Sustainable Tourism, to fortify this anchor industry, supported by the IDB.\n",
            "$68.0 million, in aggregate, for the transformative Road Infrastructure Program, including continued work on the upgrading of the Coastal Road, the Caracol Road, the George Price Highway, the Philip Goldson Highway, and for a new Haulover Bridge – just to name a few of the main infrastructure projects currently underway.\n",
            "$8.0 million for the Integral Security Program funded by CABEI, to include new police stations for the twin town of San Ignacio/Santa Elena and for Caye Caulker; a new dormitory at Price Barracks; a crime-reduction, state of the art surveillance system in Belize City; new office, transport and communications equipment for the police and the BDF; a new deep-water vessel for the Coast Guard and a new medical center at Fairweather Camp in Punta Gorda.\n",
            "$3.0 million for the Resilient Rural Belize Program funded by the IFAD to support our agricultural sector through development of climate-smart agriculture and rural infrastructure;\n",
            "But the list does not end there, Madam Speaker:\n",
            "Under the Capital II Program ─ that is the local capital programs which are funded from our own resources ─ we are making the following investment provisions:\n",
            "$ 1.5 million to commence work on the Electoral Re-Districting Program.\n",
            "$6.0 million for the continuation of the Constituency Development Program which touches all 31 Constituencies;\n",
            "$ 9.2 million to meet our Conservation Funding commitments under the Blue Bond Debt for Marine Protection Swap Program, of which 40 percent should flow to public sector agencies involved in marine conservation programs;\n",
            "$7.0 million for COVID -19 response if this is required;\n",
            "$1.0 million for Survey and Mapping of the 8,000 new lots to be distributed this year, and a further $12.0 million under the Land Development /Land Acquisition Program;\n",
            "$6.0 million under Social Assistance to provide food support to the urban and rural poor, and to the most vulnerable groups in our population;\n",
            "$24.2 million for maintenance of highways, streets and drains, rural roads, and feeder roads;\n",
            "$5.0 million for the purchase of heavy equipment and vehicles for the Ministry of Infrastructure Development – as the ministry builds its own in-house Road Construction/ Rehabilitation Unit that will more efficiently and cost effectively upgrade and maintain rural and village roads countrywide;\n",
            "$14.8 million for local counterpart contributions to some of the major road rehabilitation projects financed from foreign sources including the Caracol Road, the Coastal Road, and the Haulover Bridge;\n",
            "$5.0 million for Low-Income Housing Assistance.\n",
            "This year, Government also proposes to commence implementation of the long-overdue expansion of the National Health Insurance Program, the NHI. Healthcare, especially community-based, preventative care is the backbone of a vibrant, industrious, and healthy population. NHI is the brainchild of the last PUP Administration and 14 years later, we return to finish the good thing we started. So, this initiative is the expansion of the Program to certain areas of the country that do not currently have access, as well as to increase the number of registered participants in those areas that are currently in the Program but that have long ago reached the maximum intake by service providers.\n",
            "To expand the Program, we include an additional provision of $3.2 million this year, elevating the total allocation now to $22 million for the NHI. This will enable the commencement of the roll out of services to the Orange Walk District, expand the range of healthcare coverage for the Corozal District, as well as raising the current limits on the number of NHI participants from Belize City’s Southside.\n",
            "Madam Speaker,\n",
            "the Ministries of Health and Finance are actively seeking ways to fund the Program permanently and fully, on a national level and our goal is for this fully funded, national program to be operational by the end of this first term of office.\n",
            "Tax Recovery\n",
            "Madam Speaker,\n",
            "There has been much speculation about outstanding, uncollected taxes. This issue, rightly, gained much attention from the Unions in the circumstances where wages for public officers and teachers were reduced for this fiscal year. I had insisted that the Unions bear in mind, as they leveled their random assessment on this issue, two factors: first, that whatever taxes remained uncollected was on the account of the previous administration and second, that public officers, not Ministers, were responsible for all tax collections. Therefore, the criticism of uncollected taxes was effectively self-criticism.\n",
            "Cabinet committed to establishing a Tax Recovery Unit. This Unit began operations in October of last year. With help from CARTAC, the Unit reviewed the 18,830 accounts that carried nominal arrears of some $645 million and relating to the Belize Tax Service Department (that is, the GST, Business Tax and the PAYE levies).\n",
            "Of this $645 million: only 6 percent or $38 million were assessed within the last two years; less than 20 percent or $111 million are less than 5 years in arrears; approximately $419 million or 67 percent are noncollectable by law due to the statute of limitations or because they related to the now obsolete Sales Tax;\n",
            "Moreover, the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department experts have advised based on the US’s IRS guidance that arrears beyond three years are deemed non collectable. Nonetheless, the TRU will pursue with vigor the collection of the remaining arrears not deemed uncollectible by law.\n",
            "In addition, preliminary estimates indicate that some $334 million relating to 328,721 land accounts are outstanding. Responsibility for these accounts is in the process of being assigned to the Tax Recovery Unit. Determining what proportion of this estimate is actually collectible is a process well underway.\n",
            "The Unit’s tactics will include publishing the names of defaulters, triggering court proceedings, and activating lien and all other actions provided for by the Tax Administration and Procedure Act.\n",
            "The Ministry of Finance, supported by the Cabinet, is unreservedly committed to the collection of every penny legitimately owing to the Government, which is to say owing to the people of Belize.\n",
            "I have directed that the Tax Recovery Unit provide periodic public updates as it pursues its important assignment.\n",
            "The Wage Reinstatement\n",
            "Madam Speaker,\n",
            "Following a special Cabinet Working Session from February 24-26, I announced the policy decision to restore the 10 percent wage adjustment, which had become effective July 01 of last year. Wages will therefore be restored 2 years ahead of schedule. When I announced the adjustment in last year’s Budget, I committed that it will not last one day longer than absolutely necessary. The Cabinet and I are keeping that commitment.\n",
            "The decision to restore, in dollar terms, translates into an additional $40 million in the Personal Emoluments and $15 million in the Subsidies and Transfer line, for a total of $55 million.\n",
            "Increments, as previously programmed, are projected for reinstatement in Fiscal Year 2024/25, contingent on the fiscal circumstances.\n",
            "This year, $101 million is being allocated for pension payments.\n",
            "Taken all together, wages and pensions, including the wage-related subsidies categorized as Subsidies and Transfers, will total some $704 million.\n",
            "Let me repeat, for necessary emphasis that stunning figure: Wages, wage-related subsidies and pensions will cost Government $704 million in the coming Budget year.\n",
            "62 cents of every dollar Government collects in recurrent revenues will therefore be spent on wages and pensions.\n",
            "Using the new Budget estimates, if you account for the additional $384 million required to fund Goods & Services, Debt servicing and the non-wage component of Subsidies and Transfers, what remains for capital investments is $134 million, or 11 cents of every dollar collected.\n",
            "Belize cannot fund its capital investment needs on this meagre level of capital spending.\n",
            "Not with a dispersed population of 433,000 citizens, spread over two cities, seven towns and 200 villages. Not with a commitment for the State to provide adequate health care, a quality education, border and citizen security, a national network of roads and bridges that foster efficient economic growth, to mention just a sampling of the many purposes to be served by a national budget.\n",
            "Here are some stark facts: when the previous Administration took office in 2008, the wage bill was $234 million. When we returned to office in 2020, that obligation was an astonishing $577 million, an increase of $343 million or 150 percent. In 2008, pension spending was $38 million. Now it’s $100 million.\n",
            "Neither revenue growth nor GDP growth kept pace with wage and pension growth. Not even close. So how did the previous Administration fund this bloated wage and pension bill?\n",
            "Well, they spent money they did not have, and they borrowed, effectively to pay wages and pensions; borrowing was at a pace of $1 million per day when we took office. It is that record of reckless borrowing and spending that enfeebled the public finances and the economy so that when COVID-19 hit us, the country was brought to the brink of default and devaluation.\n",
            "To ensure medium-term stability, and in the context of the wage restoration, I wish to make these policy positions clear:\n",
            "First, national prosperity can only be achieved if the public service – those to whom $704 million will accrue in 2022 – carry out their functions effectively, which includes revenue collection. My Administration seeks an empowered, well-informed, well-trained and equipped, motivated public service as the partner of and implementer for Executive policies. There is no other proven governance recipe for national success.\n",
            "Second, Government retains a sacred obligation to all Belizeans to administer the National Budget in a manner that’s fair, that serves the national interest, that fosters justice, equality, and prosperity.\n",
            "Third, enhanced revenue collection as well as spending reform are non-negotiable priorities of this Administration. So, for example, the Tax Recovery Unit is empowered to collect what is legally due to Government, nothing more nothing less. And in the case of Public Pensions, a restructuring of the non-contributory framework is a national emergency. The strength of the public finances, a central pillar upon which the State fulfills its Constitutional obligations, will not be put at risk for a pension program which is patently unsustainable.\n",
            "I, therefore, invite the Public Service Union and all stakeholders to join in a spirit of mutual interest so that this high priority issue can be properly evaluated and a new framework formalized during this fiscal year. That is Government’s firm and necessary timeline.\n",
            "I make one final point: Cabinet is, without exception, aware of and grateful for the thousands of exemplary public officers whose competence and initiative represent the highest ideal of service. These men and women of integrity and grit plow at all levels, in all Ministries, in Government and quasi-government departments and institutions.\n",
            "I offer them our respect and gratitude, and most importantly, an assurance that we will continue to manage the public finances in a manner that makes the stability and sustainability of your job our foremost objective.\n",
            "Structural and Technical Reform\n",
            "Madam Speaker,\n",
            "This Government is transforming the way it does the people’s business. Never before, in such a short period of time, have structural reforms been embraced with such enthusiasm and efficiency. And much of the focus is on the critical functions and processes of public finance management.\n",
            "First is the introduction of active cash/money management of government’s finances to minimize interest expenses and finance charges. Recall that when we took office, the Government was borrowing almost $1 million per day. This led to habitual almost addictive recourse to issuance of treasury securities and a ballooning of Government’s overdraft with the Central Bank of over $90 million. In less than one year, this overdraft balance has been entirely eliminated under my administration without increasing the issue of domestic debt securities.\n",
            "Second is the introduction of market-based yield curve management of government-issued securities. In the history of Belize, successive governments arbitrarily determined interest rates on treasury securities to its detriment. The effect was that the government paid tens of millions more in interest expense than it should have paid. It also meant that by such above-market yields on its benchmark government securities, government was contributing to higher interest rates in the financial system. My administration is bringing that to an end in a phased manner through market-based yield curve management effective January 1, 2022. This is already materially reducing the interest expense of government that will yield millions in savings but will also create a downward pressure on interest rates in the financial system.\n",
            "Third, is the comprehensive Public Finance Management Reform Program evidenced and supported by the recent Loan Motion authorized by the National Assembly for Government to access funding from the IDB in the sum of US$8.0 million.\n",
            "This funding will support a Program consisting of four sub-component objectives which aim at strengthening public financial management: (i) improve the efficiency of key expenditure functions; (ii) promote economies of scale and competitiveness among suppliers in the procurement of all goods and services; (iii) promote a more sustainable technological infrastructure enabling processes to be more reliable and faster; (iv) improve institutional capacity for personnel to carry out processes and operate systems efficiently.\n",
            "Work in these areas has already commenced. A draft centralized public procurement Bill is in its final stages, with assistance from the IDB, while an Internal Audit Bill is being finalized as well. The former Bill will make provisions with respect to public procurement and for the retention and disposal of public property in accordance with the principles of good governance, accountability, transparency, integrity, fair competition, and value for money. It will largely align with the CARICOM model procurement law but go further. It will establish a Central Procurement Unit, a Procurement Board, and a Procurement Review Commission.\n",
            "Fourth is the Public Financial Management Support Programme, funded by the EU under the 11th EDF, which provides long term technical assistance in achieving a Public Finance Management Reform Action Plan with clear objectives linked to improving the PFM legal framework, specifically in internal and external audit and the Contractor General, as well as strengthening PFM oversight and control functions. Under this Programme, the capacity of the Auditor General’s Department and the Contractor General’s Office has been strengthened with improved working procedures, strategic planning and capacity building actions through extensive guidance, collaboration, training and development of relevant documentation; an Internal Audit Unit in the Ministry of Finance was created and the legal framework to support the work of the new unit is being developed; a large number of public officers are to be trained in the areas of audit, financial procedures, training techniques, among others; and new computer equipment was handed over to these departments, including the Accountant General’s Department, to better equip these key departments to effectively carry out their mandates.\n",
            "Fifth is the pursuit of a Fiscal Balance Sheet approach to public sector finance.\n",
            "The Government, in a phased manner and over the medium term, aims to develop full and comprehensive fiscal financial statements including a Fiscal balance sheet and a government asset inventory.\n",
            "This will be done through the implementation of Accrual Basis accounting in accordance with INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC SECTOR ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (IPSAS).\n",
            "The aim is for Belize to have a comprehensive Balance Sheet that both captures the government asset inventory of financial and non-financial assets and shows the financial net worth of the country, a Statement of Cashflows that shows the cash receipts and payments for Government’s operations, investing activities and financing activities and an Income Statement that shows the annual performance of revenues and expenses for the year.\n",
            "Over time Belize will be on a path to ensure sustainability in the face of challenges like climate change, pandemics, geopolitical shocks. Belize will be able to responsibly create and manage fiscal space required to implement Plan Belize and the reforms required to improve the quality of life for all Belizeans. Most of all this will be done in a transparent and accountable way that is likely to prevent any future undermining of value that Belize has suffered due to fiscal imprudence and will create the atmosphere of confidence required to encourage investment and attract resources on better terms.\n",
            "In this regard, Madam Speaker, Belize has approached our IFI partners for Technical Assistance and the response has been positive. We expect to commence work on this program in the upcoming fiscal year.\n",
            "Madam Speaker, we intend to table this proposed legislation in this upcoming fiscal year for House consideration and approval as we strive to modernize our public financial management systems and bring greater efficiency and accountability in the management of our public finances.\n",
            "These structural reforms are not exhaustive by any means: two other examples stand out. First, the work of the Wages Council, from which I expect the minimum wage adjustment to be implemented during this fiscal year. And second, the People’s Constitutional Commission whose core task will be to propose ways of enhancing our democratic processes and deepening citizen participation in the governance of our communities.\n",
            "Extraordinary Financing\n",
            "Madam Speaker,\n",
            "I am pleased to confirm that Belize is one of only two countries chosen by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), an independent United States Government foreign aid agency, to give support to micro, small, and medium enterprises in its effort to reduce poverty through growth. The compact and threshold programs, which will be signed between the Government of Belize and MCC could result in Belize gaining between $300 million and $1 billion in grant funding to aid in the nation’s economic development.\n",
            "Belize was chosen by the MCC Board having satisfied themselves that the current administration is committed to governing justly, investing in the development of our people and its economic policy.\n",
            "The MCC-funded projects are expected to commence in 2023 and last for a period of five years. MCC awards countries based on the principle that aid is most effective when it is reinforced by good governance.\n",
            "Madam Speaker, my Government is actively pursuing this initiative and has established a small dedicated unit in the Office of the Prime Minister to implement this program.\n",
            "I wish to take this opportunity to publicly acknowledge and thank the Government and people of the United States of America for this support and for this apparent vote of confidence in my Government and by extension, the people of Belize.\n",
            "In addition to the MCC Coordination Unit, we have set up the first-ever Climate Finance Unit in the Ministry of Economic Development to actively pursue grant funding from the specialized climate funds, primarily the Green Climate Fund (GCF).\n",
            "The Unit has hit the ground running and in the space of less than one year, has been successful in obtaining pre-accreditation support from the GCF to facilitate both the Belize Social Investment Fund and the Ministry of Economic Development itself to become fully accredited members of the Fund and in doing so bridge the gap in services provided by national accredited entities. It has also been successful in reviving tens of millions of dollars in concessionary and grant funding from IFAD and GCF under the Resilient Rural Belize Program for climate-smart agriculture and rural infrastructure, funds that were almost entirely lost due to lax behaviour and avoidable delays in implementation by the past UDP administration.\n",
            "Government is also engaged with the GCF to facilitate the direct access of the private sector through collaboration with the Caribbean Development Bank as the Delivery Partner and Belize’s Chamber of Commerce and Industry as the lead Executing Entity. And efforts are underway to provide technical support to strengthen the operational policies of the Development Finance Corporation to enable it to comply with GCF accreditation requirements and therefore gain direct access to GCF financing.\n",
            "And finally, the Office of the Prime Minister has also activated a special desk to coordinate our commitments and capitalize on opportunities related to the Financing for Marine Conservation Program, the Blue Bonds. $168 million over 20 years will flow to the Conservation Trust under this agreement, at least 40 percent of which can be directed at financing public sector marine conservation. This Special Desk will also serve as the focal point for our exciting, high-potential new collaboration with the World Wildlife Fund called the Project Finance Permanence.\n",
            "With a high degree of confidence, I predict that Belize will benefit from massive new grant flows when all these various programs get into gear.\n",
            "ACCELERATED FUNDING FROM THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA ON TAIWAN\n",
            "Madam Speaker,\n",
            "I am pleased to inform this House and the Belizean people that our Mission to Taiwan last week secured extraordinary gains for this Budget and for the economy. Last year, as you will recall, Belize and Taiwan agreed to a 5-year program of grant and concessionary loan funding that totaled US 105m. So far, and including this Budget for Fiscal Year 2022/23, Government will have drawn down US$15m in grants and US$42m in soft loans. Taiwan has now agreed that in this Fiscal Year, Belize can proceed to apply for the entire remainder USD 48m under this Agreement, in effect, converting a 5-year program to a 2-year program. In principle, the focal areas for investing these additional funds will be in education – expanding the Healthy Start Feeding Program and eventually, the Digital Devices Program; in Housing – expanding our current target for distributing quality, low cost housing units countrywide; and in financing SME credit, especially low interest loans in the Agro-productive sector.\n",
            "In the coming months, I will table a supplementary appropriations bill that will confirm each Program along with its funding amounts, for consideration and approval.\n",
            "And there is more exceptional news: I am elated to formally announce a USD 16.8m grant from Taiwan for the design and construction of a new hospital for Ambergris Caye, that hospital to commence construction in this fiscal year. The new hospital will be a 45-bed, 28,000 square feet state of the art facility providing primary and secondary care services. Others before us made hollow promises to build this much-needed facility. It is this PUP Government that will finally deliver for the people of Ambergris Caye and of Belize Rural South.\n",
            "Medium-Term Budget Forecast\n",
            "Madam Speaker,\n",
            "Our Finance Team has included in the Budget a medium-term, 4-year forecast, with targets through to Fiscal Year 26/27.\n",
            "We envision revenues growing in the early years by 3 to 4 percent and levelling off at 2 percent growth in the outer years of the forecast period. Our goal is to hold firm on spending limits, at least for the short term, with expenditures rising by 2 to 3 percent starting in FY 25/26.\n",
            "To stabilize the public finances, a primary surplus of at least 2 percent of GDP is the bare minimum necessary. This is the goal identified in these projections, mainly because of restoring wages and withholding new revenue adjustments.\n",
            "Overall net financing for the 5-year period, including the new Budget, will be some $243 million; that is, the difference between required Budget financing and amortization payments. On the basis that GDP growth will exceed this new debt, the country’s debt to GDP will fall over the medium term.\n",
            "I would also emphasize that Government expects capital investments – the combination of Capital II and III financing – to total $1.42 billion over this 5-year period.\n",
            "Conclusion\n",
            "Madam Speaker,\n",
            "The journey of sound public finance management is a constant, never-ending endeavor.\n",
            "No matter how much progress is made in one budget period, risks arise in another that can quickly undo that progress.\n",
            "In just the last few weeks, war has erupted in Eastern Europe. The unimaginable specter of oil at over US$200 per barrel presents a real and present danger to the Belizean economy and public finances.\n",
            "At US$200 per barrel, the cost of fuel imports could more than double to over Belize $30 million dollars per month, representing a massive drain on foreign exchange and, at some point, a substantial loss of revenue.\n",
            "Rising oil prices will worsen the recessionary risks, and clearly, inflationary pressures, such pressures escalating even before the Russian invasion of the Ukraine. This is an urgent situation about which I intend to consult later this week with our social partners and key sectoral representatives.\n",
            "Covid-19, another prominent risk, has receded in recent weeks but the scientists have certainly not ruled out the possibility of a new variant which could disrupt the delicate recovery of the travel and tourism sectors. When compared to 2019, Belize’s 2021 economic rebound entailed only a 46 percent recovery in overnight tourism arrivals and an 18 percent recovery in cruise arrivals. In other words, for our most vital economic subsector, 2021’s bounce-back represented only a partial recovery.\n",
            "In addition to these external variables, there is the urgent need for the Budget to permanently balance the mix between recurrent and capital spending. In this fiscal year, as I highlighted before, 85 cents of every recurrent dollar in revenue will be spent on recurrent expenditure, the largest component of which is Government’s wage and pension obligations.\n",
            "With pride and purpose, we have proposed this Fiscal Year 22/23 construct to allow time for the economic recovery to solidify and for wage relief to offset rising inflation.\n",
            "This posture must evolve as the circumstances evolve.\n",
            "For sustainability, I emphasize, revenue buoyancy must continue, and recurrent spending must remain within strict limits, if we are to avoid subsequent adjustments to both tax revenue and recurrent spending.\n",
            "Despite these broad cautions, my colleagues and I carry ever more optimism about the future of our young nation. As businesses and schools accelerate their re-opening, with public wages restored and private minimum wages soon to be raised, as Government’s capital investments converge on bridging the welfare and opportunity gaps, with trade and investment policies reaping increased dividends, I eagerly anticipate a multi-year economic expansion, with the thousands of new jobs and hundreds of new enterprises envisioned in our Manifesto.\n",
            "That every Belizean should win, and in that glorious sum of collective betterment, for our precious Jewel to shine ever brighter among nations, this shall remain our Administration’s clarion call.\n",
            "When I presented my Government’s first Budget last year, I proposed a 5-Point Recovery Plan. Despite the doubt of the then leader of the opposition who said it could not and would not be done, every single one of these points have been effectively addressed during this year:\n",
            "Our Budget pared wages and kept spending within projected parameters;\n",
            "A historic debt restructuring eliminated half a billion in public debt;\n",
            "Revenues over-performed allowing us the flexibility to table supplementary investments during the financial year;\n",
            "Every major investment-climate indicator has improved: the trade balance narrowed, the current account balance was the smallest in years, bank capital and liquidity are ample, lending rates are down and reserves up, while the official and private sector are more enthused about Belize than in recent memory.\n",
            "And Pension Reform is programmed for this year.\n",
            "These are the unmistakable measures of progress, the bellwethers of even greater, more inclusive expansion and prosperity.\n",
            "If Belize is to grow and develop, all of us must be committed to a strong Belizean economy and society, grounded in credible, practical plans and solutions to the social and economic challenges we face.\n",
            "With hands and hearts joined together in this great experiment we move forward to build a nation of prosperous citizens. To live out those fundamental principles enshrined in our Constitution and we remain dedicated to the enhancement of a nation people who not only believe but remain committed to social economic and environmental justice.\n",
            "I thank my Parliamentary colleagues, the technicians at the line Ministries and the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank, and the many professions involved with the preparation of this National Budget for Fiscal Year 2022/23.\n",
            "I commend this Appropriations Bill for the House’s consideration.\n",

            "Good morning everyone,\n",
            "I am so pleased to be back here at my alma mater and so proud to see such inspiring and thriving young minds gathered here in the name of a sustainable future.\n",
            "Everywhere I go, I display my pride as a green Giant proudly. As an alumnus of this great institute of learning, I am well aware of the high-quality education that you have access to – although when I was younger I probably didn’t fully grasp just how valuable it was.\n",
            "When we are young, it’s rare that we learn to love these formative experiences in life until well after they have passed. Every conversation, every lesson you learn – even in the classes where you’re struggling to stay awake – every topic that piques your curiosity and stokes your inner fire leaves a lasting impression that will guide you through the journey of life.\n",
            "Today, I have no doubt that I am standing in the presence of some of the brightest young minds in The Bahamas. The fact that you could be using your youthful energy and intelligence to further your personal interests in any way you desire, and you are choosing to spend your time making your country a better place is commendable. But I should expect nothing less from fellow Giants.\n",
            "We are here today to drive action on climate change, marine conservation, and our collective well-being.\n",
            "I remember just a couple of years ago, when I was your age. I didn’t know where life would take me, but I was sure that I wanted to make a meaningful contribution to society – not just for my own sake, but for my family, my community, and my country.\n",
            "I eventually chose to make a difference through the law, pursuing justice and fair outcomes for the many clients I have had over the years. Eventually, as my passion for my people and my nation grew and my desire to live in a fair and just country for everyone could no longer be ignored, I embraced public service. Through it all, my formative experiences in life continued to be a guiding light – not just as a student at this institution – but my early experience of the natural beauty of island life growing up in Cat Island. Because I’ve always known the sacred beauty of our natural environment, I have always been a firm advocate for conservation.\n",
            "What we have here in The Bahamas is unlike anywhere else in the world. Our landscapes, both marine and terrestrial, are contenders to be world wonders. US astronaut Scot Kelly has said on multiple occasions that The Bahamas is the most beautiful place from space. And we are just as beautiful up close as we are from hundreds of miles away.\n",
            "Within this immense beauty is also the potential to support livelihoods through fishing, agriculture and aquaculture, and tourism.\n",
            "That is why my government has prioritised the cultivation of the blue and green economies from day one. It is critical that we protect our marine and coastal environments to fully tap into the unbridled potential for economic growth and sustainability that we know exists.\n",
            "For this reason, we must remain committed to protecting and preserving the valuable natural assets that we have.\n",
            "Our waters are the lifeline of our economy, our heritage, and our people. It is our duty to protect them. Organisations like BREEF are doing incredibly valuable work that benefits us all.\n",
            "We must all support these efforts and work together to mitigate the ongoing threats to our environment. Some of the threats are internal, like overconsumption, which is one of the biggest contributors to pollution of our environment and the depletion of stocks of marine species due to unsustainable harvesting practices.\n",
            "Other forces at work are external, particularly climate change, which poses the biggest threat to our environment and people. We have already seen the effects of temperature increases on our waters, triggering coral bleaching events that impact the entire region.\n",
            "The effects of climate change are only projected to get worse, which puts both us, our environment, and the flora and fauna that coexist with us at risk. That is why I continue to advocate for more action and assistance for Small Island Developing States like ours on the world stage.\n",
            "We must also lead the way by adopting a cleaner, more environmentally friendly way of life. The government recognises the important role it plays as we transition our islands to renewable forms of energy like solar.\n",
            "As young leaders, you have the power to promote conservation, to advance climate justice, and to effect change. And we all have individual contributions we can make as well.\n",
            "We can all use less single-use plastics and less fossil fuels in our personal lives – whether that means a future vehicle purchase that is hybrid or electric, being more conscious of our electricity consumption, or choosing sustainably packaged products and finding ways to reuse the plastic products that we purchase.\n",
            "As young leaders – and not just young leaders, but young Giants – you must not underestimate the impact of your voices. Speak up and speak loudly! Each one of you has a part to play in securing a sustainable future.\n",
            "We can all be effective advocates. So stand up today, and demand a better future!.\n",
            "Absorb these discussions we have today so you can arm yourself with even more knowledge to be a more effective advocate and changemaker in this world.\n",
            "Our country is worth fighting for – to preserve all that is beautiful about our environment, our way of life, and our people. Let’s all commit to doing our part to fight for progress.\n",

            "Mr. Speaker,\n",
            "I rise this evening on behalf of the proud, strong, and ever resilient people of the great constituency of North Abaco, who saw it fit to elect me to this honourable place some three years ago. I am mindful that it is upon their shoulders I stand, and without them my place here today would not be possible – and for that Mr. Speaker I am eternally grateful.\n",
            "Let me begin by once more expressing on behalf of my wife and family our profound condolences to the families that loss loved ones during the passage of Hurricane Dorian. Please know that our thoughts and prayers remain with you all as we continue to work through the processes of bringing closure where possible.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker,\n",
            "The past three years have undoubtedly been plagued with a number of challenges. We—in North and Central Abaco and the surrounding Cays—continue the long, challenging and hard road to recovery and restoration, following the most unwelcomed visit to our shores by hurricane Dorian;; a ferocious category 5 storm that decimated our island, leaving behind widespread destruction, damaging thousands of homes, several schools, clinics, roads and infrastructure. Mr. Speaker, Dorian was the worst storm to make landfall in The Bahamas since 1851, when these records first saw their genesis. When it was all over Mr. Speaker, Dorian had left behind a total of $3.4 billion in damages according to the Inter-­American Development Bank (IDB) – almost twice as much as our projected revenue for this upcoming fiscal period.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker this clearly underscores the severe difficulties that we as a country are facing from a fiscal standpoint, as we continue to balance ongoing recovery efforts in Abaco and Grand Bahama, with the continued provision of normal public services to the rest of The Bahamas.\n",
            "It is no secret Mr. Speaker that the majority of The Bahamas’ population is concentrated on the island of New Providence, and that much of our family islands remain largely unvisited by many Bahamians, but for those of us who knew Abaco pre-­Dorian, upon traveling to the island in the wake of this monster storm, the beautiful gem that we once knew was now virtually unrecognizable. Mr. Speaker, one would only need to fly over the island, and on approach to the Leonard Thompson or Treasure Cay International Airports, would’ve witnessed what can only be described as a scene out of a warzone. In a matter of hours Mr. Speaker, entire livelihoods were completely erased;; homes, belongings, and yes, even family members lost and lives shattered, as mother-­nature ruthlessly violated our peaceful island.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker, as an Abaco Member of Parliament, I can recall the absolute fear, and feelings of trepidation while being advised by researchers and meteorologists that the strongest storm ever to pass through the Atlantic Ocean was about to make a direct hit to the island that I not only call home, but where thousands of Bahamians that I represent waited in terror, dreading what was to come. Mr. Speaker I recall sadly, having to balance the duty of warning residents to leave and seek shelter immediately, while facing the grim reality that this storm, considered as “Category Hell” was about to mercilessly wreak havoc on our beloved island, changing the lives of Abaconians forever.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker, what do you do now after seeing entire communities erased, observing only tiles, damaged kitchen appliances and property foundations that serve as a chilling reminder and geographic indicator of where homes once stood. Steel frame buildings, and shipping containers crumpled like discarded paper, and the entire island basically flattened as if an atomic bomb had just been detonated. The only response to such a disaster Mr. Speaker, especially for the industrious people of Abaco, was to rebuild.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker, the road to recovery has been paved with many challenges, but it has also been met with opportunity. Along with the Managing Director of the Disaster and Reconstruction Authority, Katherine Forbes Smith, and her team, and Local Government practitioners, I have participated in a number of Town Hall Meetings in North Abaco, aimed at informing constituents of the Government’s programs intended to aide our recovery. The meetings serve, among other things, two very essential purposes.\n",
            "First, to update constituents on recovery efforts and second;; to hear their views and concerns as to what the Government might be doing better to ameliorate their conditions. Mr. Speaker, while the Bahamas has indeed been the victim of severe hurricanes over the past decades, Hurricane Dorian however, was like none other, and has caused widespread generational damage, that will likely still be felt by our children and grandchildren in years to come. None of us have been this way before and we must work together to achieve the best possible result.\n",
            "The Disaster and Reconstruction Authority launched its “Small Home Repair Program” in Abaco on the 10th of February and from all accounts, it appears to be going well and making relatively good progress. I am advised that as at 31 May, 2020 more than three thousand, two hundred (3,200) applications have been received from the impacted residents of Abaco and Grand Bahama whose homes were destroyed or damaged during the passage of Hurricane Dorian. Of this number Mr. Speaker, there are some one thousand and seventy-­three (1,073) applicants from Abaco, of which almost 60% of those have already been approved to receive funding to assist with renovating their homes. Those remaining Mr. Speaker, are either still required to upload additional documents or are pending approval. I am advised that some $1.87 million has already been spent in the form of purchase orders that have been issued to homeowners for the purchase of construction materials from hardware supply stores on Abaco and Grand Bahama.\n",
            "I want to encourage Abaconians to get their documents into the small home repair office at the Government Complex or upload online (where you can) in an effort to complete your application for processing;; I understand persons in the Cays are also registering and I want to encourage all Bahamians living in the Cays and mainland Abaco who meet the criteria to continue to register for assistance. It is up to the home owner to complete the registration with all required documents so the process can move as quickly as possible. If there are challenges with the registration process, let us know so that they might be urgently addressed.\n",
            "I am pleased to advise the office is open in Abaco and I trust residents will take advantage of the opportunity to receive much needed assistance. I am also pleased to report Mr. Speaker that in light of the COVID-­19 pandemic, the Disaster and Reconstruction Authority is now able to continue program registrations and home assessments in Abaco through the use of an RV that has been donated by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Rotary. The programme will now be able to move throughout the northern communities. It is also envisaged that the Technical Assistance Programme in conjunction with the UNDP will assist with the implementation of best practices with regard to construction.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker, there have been a total of thirty-­two (32) temporary housing domes erected in Spring City, with an additional one hundred and seventy-­three (173) to be erected on the properties of various homeowners while they monitor the rebuilding of their homes. I am advised that this process has begun today, June 8th and that the Authority is currently working along with Social Services to ensure that persons meet the criteria set. Mr. Speaker, one would have had to have his or her home destroyed as a result of Hurricane Dorian, must be a Bahamian, and either a senior citizen, disabled, or a family with minor children in order to qualify.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker, the Disaster and Reconstruction Authority is also working on permanent housing solutions for the residents of Abaco. The Authority is currently completing an agreement to construct forty-­six (46) homes in Central Pines, Abaco. Mr. Speaker the Government of The Bahamas will be responsible for the provision of land, and the development of infrastructure, and the selected company will then construct the homes with increased levels of resiliency and incorporating “Build Back Better Policies”. (Murphy Town, potential)\n",
            "Additionally Mr. Speaker, a pre-­qualification notice has been issued to the entire public inviting Bahamian businesses to submit proposals for the development of a mixed-­use residential development to be constructed in Spring City and Wilson City in Abaco. Mr. Speaker, two (2) -­ sixty (60) acre lots have been provided by the Government for this development.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker to date, there have been mountains of debris that have been cleared, so much so that debris management sites have now become overwhelmed. I am advised that the debris management site at Spring City has already been expanded due to excessive volumes. This again emphasizes the absolute mayhem that Dorian unleashed on our communities. To remediate this issue Mr. Speaker, the Authority has published Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for debris management, to which sixty-­three (63) companies have already responded.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker, RFPs are currently being developed for the demolition of the Treasure Cay Airport building, as the Authority examines possible temporary housing solutions for a new facility.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker, construction is ongoing at the SC Bootle High School, Cooper’s Town Primary, Central Abaco Primary School and Amy Roberts School in Green Turtle Cay. There remains some work to be done to the school at Grand Cay.\n",
            "With respect to assisting our entrepreneurs in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian Mr. Speaker, the Small Business Development Center has already approved forty nine (49) applications for funding for residents of Abaco. Over seven hundred and thirty-­six thousand dollars ($736,000.00) in grants, some five hundred andseventy thousand dollars ($570,000) in micro loans, and three hundred and thirty-­five thousand dollars ($335,000) in guaranteed loans have been received by business owners on the island of Abaco.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker, I am also pleased to announce that the Authority has identified a location for the development of a Community Center/Hurricane Shelter on Abaco. This project is being developed through the deepening of our diplomatic relations with the Republic of India, which I will touch on later in my contribution.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker, perhaps of greatest importance to the people of Abaco is the restoration of electricity. I am aware of the burdens that many Abaconians are currently experiencing. Hurricane Dorian completely obliterated the electrical grid in Central and North Abaco. Transmission and distribution systems were completely destroyed. Bahamas Power and Light is working feverishly along with the Ministry of Public works to ensure that homes are properly inspected and reconnected in the quickest time possible. BPL is also working to bring temporary generation sites online in an attempt to bring much needed relief to residents.\n",
            "To date, electrical supply has been restored in areas of Cooper’s Town, Fox Town, Blackwood, Crown Haven, Fire Road, Wood Cay, Cedar Harbour and Mount Hope. Supply has also been restored to parts of Moore’s Island, Central Abaco and Green Turtle Cay, with ongoing work to transmission and distribution systems on Man-­o-­War Cay and Elbow Cay. I trust that my Honourable Friend from Carmichael will also shed light on these matters when he takes the floor.\n",
            "Additionally, Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the Executive Chairman of the Water & Sewerage Corporation— the Honourable Member from Long Island—for the work they continue to do to restore our water supplies. On 23 May, the Corporation signed two groundbreaking contracts to assist our post-­Dorian recovery in Treasure Cay and Marsh Harbour, where substantial infrastructure was destroyed.\n",
            "As such, I wish now to commend the Managing Director and her team for their efforts—thus far—and to assure her of my full cooperation and support toward making Abaco whole again. Mr. Speaker, please permit me at this juncture to personally thank individuals like Bishop Silbert Mills, Fred Gottlieb, Jeremy Sweeting and, recently appointed, Mrs. Gisselle McKintosh of Abaco that also serve on the Disaster and Reconstruction Authority, and have been strong voices in advancing both the suggestions and concerns of their fellow residents during the reconstruction process. Only together with—the Government, the International\n",
            "Community, the Private Sector, Non-­Governmental Organizations (Domestic and Foreign), Civil Society and we who are the victims—can effectively answer the challenge of Dorian.\n",
            "That said, Mr. Speaker, this is not a popular thing to say in the midst of what we face, but it’s the truth, no country our size—in fact even larger countries—can effectively respond to a catastrophic event the size of Dorian without considered help from others. Mr. Speaker, it would be remiss of me not to offer my sincerest gratitude to the numerous NGO’s that have assisted us in this fight;; The Bahamas Red Cross, The United Nations Development Programme, Samaritan’s Purse, Church by The Sea, UNICEF, The Lyford Cay Foundation, The Albany Foundation, All Hands and Hearts, and the GEMS organization, just to name a few.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker, while we continue to grapple with the aftermath of Dorian, we find ourselves in the midst of the deadly COVID-­19 pandemic that has left virtually no country unscathed. This virus has taken its toll not only on the thousands of lives that have been lost globally, but also on the world economy. There are over five (5) million confirmed cases globally and the disease has claimed the lives of greater than three hundred and fifty thousand (350,000) persons. Global trade continues to decline rapidly, falling even faster than global GDP, with forecasts showing it to be the worst recession in eighty (80) years. Furthermore, the World Bank has warned that up to sixty (60) million people will be pushed into ‘extreme poverty’ due to the coronavirus and the bank expects global economic growth to shrink by 5% this year as nations deal with the pandemic.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker, for any country, making the hard decisions of restricting movement and implementing tough policies, or facing the harsh realities that even many first-­world countries are now experiencing, which are seemingly innumerable cases of the virus and thousands of accompanied deaths seems like an easy choice, but the difficult economic impact to citizens however, is an unfortunate consequence. Regrettably, The Bahamas will not be spared as economic conditions worsen and this has been outlined in detail by the Deputy Prime Minister during his introduction of the 2020/2021 Budget. Tough decisions will have to be made in the days and months ahead;; however, by the grace of God, with the exercise of fiscal prudence and strict management of our resources, we shall get through the difficult times that lie ahead of us.\n",
            "Just before I leave North Abaco to address the ministry for which I have carriage, Mr. Speaker, permit me to say to the people of Little Abaco that we are working with Chief Councilor Garnet Edgecombe and his Local Government Team to erect your much needed cemetery on land already identified.\n",
            "I know we still have quite a ways to go, but I also know that we have made positive steps in the right direction. I only ask your continued hard work, teamwork and cooperation as we build back a bigger, better, more resilient Abaco.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker,\n",
            "In 2017, the Government of The Bahamas mandated the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to strengthen, enhance and grow our country’s relationship with the international community. Likewise, we were also tasked with doing our part to strengthen our country’s security and economy. Today, I can report that we continue to make our best efforts toward achieving these mandates. We remain steadfast in our exertions to protect and preserve our country’s sovereignty while keenly executing our policies both at home and abroad.\n",
            "And so, I take this opening to publicly thank the committed staff of the Ministry, for their patriotism and resolve toward making our country the best it can be despite the many varied challenges we encounter daily.\n",
            "To date, the Ministry has accomplished much of what we set out to do in this budget period. We are very proud of hiring of eight (8) qualified and extremely focused young Bahamians as Foreign Service Officers. They have undergone the requisite professional training in preparation of their role in protecting this country’s interest wherever they are assigned. A vibrant, committed team of officers is critically important in transforming the Ministry and for the advancement of our foreign policy.\n",
            "As we forge ahead and seek to establish greater diplomatic relations, gain a more strategic presence and become more actively engaged as members of international organizations, we seek to recruit and prepare new officers to take on these challenges as soon as our fiscal circumstances permit.\n",
            "The training programmes offered within the Ministry and Government services to all staff is a critical element for progress in my Ministry given that opportunities for international training are currently curtailed. The creative structure within my Ministry will allow room for optimal growth and productivity. The stringent measures outlined in the Budget are not expected to compromise the integrity of work to be done in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its overseas Missions. The strategic placement of officers in key positions is\n",
            "critical to the efficiency and effectiveness in the operation of every section of my Ministry. To this end, the recalls and postings of Foreign Service Officers will be delayed at this time and will be considered in the near future as we advance into our ‘new normal’ operational procedures.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker,\n",
            "As it relates to our regional and international partnerships\n",
            "I am happy to report that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs continues to strengthen and improve our relationship with regional and international partners. Nowhere was this more demonstrative than during and in the aftermath of hurricane Dorian, when the world came to our aid. I take this opportunity to thank the many countries, international organizations, private sector and civil society groups that came and remain to assist us with our rebuilding and restoration efforts. Once again, we can attest to the support that The Bahamas has received from our regional and international partners in the midst of the COVID-­19 pandemic. In particular, I wish to express sincere appreciation to the United States (US), China, India and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) who have generously donated much needed medical supplies and equipment during this time of the pandemic. I take opportunity to also thank the Government of Canada for its contribution of five million dollars ($5M) to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) to procure much needed supplies for the Caribbean region in the fight against the COVID-­19 pandemic.\n",
            "In the midst of a deadly pandemic, our pace of interaction with friends in the international community remains strong and continues to increase. With the use of virtual platforms such as Zoom, Go To Meetings and Cisco/Webex, we have been able to hold bilateral meetings and participate in more meetings than usual. While COVID-­19 has dominated much of the discussion, we have been able to speak to other important issues that impact the economic well-­being of The Bahamas and collaborated with other countries to fight the immoral blacklisting proposed by the European Commission (EC). The Bahamas, along with CARICOM countries and other impacted countries, will do everything in its power to ward this off\n",
            "Due to The Bahamas being perceived as a high income country, we have found it difficult to attract assistance for rebuilding efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian and much of the aid that has emerged for COVID-­ 19 is not available to The Bahamas. For the most part, we can only access such aid when it is part of a regional package. For example, the European Union (EU) has provided USD8.9 million to help combat the\n",
            "virus in the Caribbean. This funding is from a regional envelope that will be managed by the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) and The Bahamas is able to access some of these funds via this agency.\n",
            "Other initiatives such as the United Nations (UN) Secretary General’s Humanitarian Response Plan, the UN Response and Recovery Fund and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) COVID-­19 Response are largely unavailable to The Bahamas. We are confronted not only with the disasters of Hurricane Dorian and COVID-­19 and the subsequent current economic crisis wrought by both, but also the disaster of an unrelenting international financial system that does not value the challenges faced by small island developing nations. It is a vicious cycle in which we find ourselves, but it is a cycle we must overcome through constant engagement with our partners and friends together with ingenuity and innovation.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker,\n",
            "The recent events in The Bahamas and the world have highlighted the need for all of us to operate differently in all aspects of our lives. Hurricane Dorian and now COVID-­19 have changed The Bahamas forever. As we begin to move toward a ‘new normal’, we have to approach everyday life in a new way. In the immediate future and out of necessity, the way we operated will never be the same. We must take the lessons that we have learnt from the past and apply them or we will be prone to repeat our past mistakes. The budget will challenge the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take a different approach to achieve its goals over the next year.\n",
            "I have given a directive to scrutinize every portion of the budget to see where savings can be made and to expend funds only on that which is deemed necessary. Travel will be severely curtailed and we will endeavour to make use of virtual platforms to participate in meetings wherever possible. Of note, under this ‘new normal’ the 75th UN General Assembly will occur as a virtual meeting in September of this year as will many other UN meetings for the remainder of this year.\n",
            "As the Bible (Luke 12:48) says, ‘For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required’. We, as a country are blessed to have in our Public Service a pool of many talented individuals and certainly in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs which I am privileged to lead. Together, we will ‘chart our way’ through the many challenges that face us as a nation and a people. Through ‘dedication, duty and continued delivery’, the\n",
            "services rendered by those in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs during this lengthy and tedious lockdown period did not waver and I will describe this in greater detail shortly.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker,\n",
            "The United Kingdom\n",
            "I am pleased to report the return of the British High Commission to The Bahamas since its closure in 2005. In August 2019, the United Kingdom (UK) appointed High Commissioner to The Bahamas, Her Excellency (HE) Sarah Dickson. Subsequent to this appointment, The Bahamas has seen the re-­opening of the British High Commission on Wednesday 12 February 2020. The re-­opening of the British High Commission allows The Bahamas immediate access to the British Government as it relates to consultations and initiatives between our countries.\n",
            "As we seek to further enhance our relationship post-­Brexit—on 27 November 2019, The Bahamas became the latest CARICOM state to ensure trade continuity with the UK—following on from the ten-­year-­old Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) signed between the Caribbean Forum (CARIFORUM) and the European Union, The Bahamas and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, have signed an EPA, which will come into force on 31 December 2020.\n",
            "The Kingdom of Belgium\n",
            "In keeping with our mandate to grow our international relations, The Bahamas officially opened an Embassy to the Kingdom of Belgium and a Mission to the European Union (EU) in Brussels on 13 November 2019 to protect and promote our economic interests. It is anticipated that our resident Ambassador (HE) Maria O’Brien will deepen our relations with the EU, which will give rise to strengthening of the Bahamian economy and The Bahamas’ position in the global economic market.\n",
            "Further, as a member of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) community, The Bahamas recently attended the 8th ACP Summit in Nairobi, Kenya during December of 2019. During our visit to Brussels to participate in the opening of the Embassy, members may recall that the Prime Minister addressed the ACP Committee of Ambassadors at ACP House during 14 November 2019. It is expected that our physical presence and participation in the EU-­ACP will allow for deepened relations in regards to trade, political\n",
            "dialogue, development and cooperation. We will continue to leverage our membership in the ACP to stem off unfair blacklisting by the European Union.\n",
            "Geneva, Switzerland\n",
            "Moreover, I am pleased to report that on 17 February, Ambassador (HE) Keva Bain—an attorney-­at-­law, career civil servant, former foreign service officer and with expertise in trade matters—was posted as Permanent Representative to the UN Offices in Geneva and the Ambassador to Switzerland. We were all pleased as a nation to see Ambassador Bain preside over the 73rd World Health Assembly (WHA) where COVID-­19 dominated the agenda. She was pressed into duty at short notice and she rose admirably to the occasion.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker,\n",
            "In addition to the support I have already indicated that was given by the United States, the bilateral relations between the United States (US) and The Bahamas remains strong. Since January to the present, there have been a number of significant achievements shared between both countries of which I would like to highlight a few.\n",
            "In January of this year, I was among a caucus of Caribbean nations whose Foreign Ministers attended the Ministerial Roundtable in Kingston, Jamaica, hosted by the United States (US) Secretary of State the Honourable Michael Pompeo. The high-­level meeting provided a platform for discussions on shared democratic values and critical hemispheric matters particularly security, development cooperation, prosperity and human rights. Talks also centered on financial services inclusive of blacklistings and de-­risking, youth empowerment, education and the diversification of the OAS, all crucial to US-­Caribbean relations.\n",
            "On the sidelines of the formal meeting, I discussed with Secretary Pompeo the humanitarian support that the US provided to The Bahamas post Hurricane Dorian and the rebuilding efforts, among other things. During the talks, I conveyed the gratitude of the Bahamian people, particularly those from Abaco and Grand Bahama, for the solidarity and support of the United States which has provided safe harbour and aid to some four hundred (400) persons as well as thirty four million dollars (USD34M) in humanitarian assistance for The Bahamas\n",
            "To date, the Government of the United States continues to stand side-­by-­side with The Bahamas as the reconstruction effort continues. Of note, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has provided enough funding for Samaritan’s Purse to continue its work with the rebuilding effort for the remainder of this year (2020). To this end, Samaritan’s Purse continues to assist with water, sanitation, health and shelter in the hurricane ravaged communities.\n",
            "In January of this year, the US Embassy in conjunction with the Government of The Bahamas launched the Academy of Women Entrepreneurs (AWE) to harness the full participation of women in the economy. In keeping with the priority of the Government relative to economic diversification, the Academy hopes to spark business creativity by way of its educational curriculum, as well as, through advocacy, financing and mentoring which could potentially translate into opportunities for Bahamians.\n",
            "To culminate the month of January, was the signing of the new revitalized Air Service Agreement (ASA) which saw the creation of more cost-­effective and convenient aviation routes, in particular increased direct flights from the US to the Family Islands. As one of the main focuses of the Government is to stimulate economic growth, this ASA will serve to increase the number of ‘stop-­over’ visitors desirous of enjoying our vibrant culture and exploring the pristine waters of the archipelago.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker,\n",
            "India\n",
            "As I alluded to earlier in my opening remarks, India was one of the first countries to visit The Bahamas after Hurricane Dorian and presented to the Prime Minister a cheque for one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) to support the relief and restoration effort. Subsequently, the India CARICOM Summit was held in the margins of the United Nations 74th General Assembly during last September. During the Summit, the Honourable Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India, pledged a grant of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) for each CARICOM country toward community development projects. The Bahamas has submitted a proposal for the construction of a community center/hurricane shelter in Central Abaco and we await India’s decision on the proposal. India, as evidenced by the support for post hurricane reconstruction and COVID-­19 has proven to be an invaluable friend and ally to The Bahamas.\n",
            "China\n",
            "China’s support and friendship for The Bahamas has been unwavering. China was amongst the first to give support in the aftermath of Dorian and throughout the COVID-­19 pandemic. As it relates to hurricane relief, China provided an initial donation of one hundred and twenty thousand dollars ($20k initially from the Embassy in Nassau and $100k from the Chinese Red Cross) and a further donation of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) which was deposited directly into the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) account. China has signaled its readiness to provide additional support to our recovery efforts.\n",
            "In August 2019, the Quarantine and Health Requirements Protocol for Edible Aquatic Animals was signed in Beijing by the Embassy of The Bahamas (on behalf of the Government of The Bahamas) and by the General Administration of Customs of the People’s Republic of China. The exports of live lobster from The Bahamas to China are now proceeding. Further, The Bahamas and China also signed an Air Services Agreement (ASA) during the General Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization in September of last year.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker,\n",
            "Our relations with other countries are of equal importance. During the early part of 2020, the technical arm of the Ministry held in-­depth discussions with the Ambassadors of several countries including Canada, Italy, Belgium and Turkey. A number of areas were identified for technical cooperation and assistance. These areas included sustainable development, preservation of oceans and the blue economy, health, education, trade and investment. As soon as it is practicably possible, these discussions will resume with the involvement of other agencies of the Government and discussions will also be undertaken with other countries.\n",
            "In February of this year, I presided over a very productive meeting with the EU representation in Jamaica. The annual meeting, referred to as the Article 8 Dialogue was held in The Bahamas at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Meeting attendees included representatives from Sweden, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Belgium and Portugal. The Ambassador and Head of the Jamaica Office, agreed to take our concerns about blacklisting to the EU and to keep us apprised of developments regarding the same.\n",
            "We identified many areas of convergence relative to human rights, except on the question of the death penalty. There was agreement to collaborate in the future on issues such as cyber security, climate change, renewable energy and the Blue Economy. A future meeting is proposed for February 2021, with technical level discussions taking place in advance.\n",
            "I must add here that a few months after the meeting, the Ambassador expressed surprise on hearing of the EC decision to blacklist The Bahamas yet again in its publication on 6 May 2020. As you know, the Government took immediate action to question this apparent immoral action;; set in the midst of the biggest global crisis in modern history.\n",
            "Honorary Consuls of The Bahamas\n",
            "The Government of The Bahamas, since becoming independent, has appointed thirty six (36) Honorary Consuls in various parts of the world. The primary purpose for appointing these persons was to assist Bahamians in distress where the Government of The Bahamas had no representation either by way of a Mission or a Tourist Office. These persons have truly shown their importance during this time when we are dealing with the COVID-­19 pandemic which has caused so many of our nationals to be displaced all around the world. The secondary purpose was to promote The Bahamas and assist in building its economy.\n",
            "Presently there are thirty one (31) Honorary Consuls and the Government of The Bahamas has begun a further review of various countries/jurisdictions where diplomatic relations can be established and further benefits for the Bahamas can be derived. As a result of this, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in possession of a number of applications from persons who have expressed an interest in becoming Honorary Consuls for The Bahamas. Further consideration will be given to their applications once due process and Interpol security vetting have been completed.\n",
            "Countries and jurisdictions presently under immediate consideration for the appointment of Honorary Consuls are Hong Kong, India, Turkey, Brazil, Indonesia, Puerto Rico and various states in the US.\n",
            "CARICOM\n",
            "On 18-­19 February of this year, the Prime Minister led a delegation to the 31st Intercessional Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) which was held in\n",
            "Bridgetown, Barbados, where a number of pivotal and germane issues to the community were discussed. Additionally, in the margins of the meeting, The Bahamas participated in bilateral meetings with Canada, New Zealand and the Secretary General to the Commonwealth.\n",
            "CARICOM continues to be one of the strongest allies for The Bahamas. The coordination work that we normally undertake in the global arena continued during the pandemic and proved to be particularly effective. During the course of the COVID-­19 crisis, CARICOM met at the level of Heads of Government, Ministers of Health, Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Tourism to discuss and formulate regional responses and policies to address the multifaceted impact of COVID-­19.\n",
            "The Bahamas will continue to coordinate its efforts with the Caribbean Community as CARICOM Member States have committed to unite and pool its resources to addressing the myriad challenges that this pandemic has posed to the region.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker,\n",
            "While on the topic of meetings, I would like to highlight that The Bahamas was set to host the 50th General Assembly (GA) of the Organization of American States (OAS) on 9-­11 June of this year. The commitment to host the GA was undertaken at the 49th OAS General Assembly which was held in June 2019 in Colombia. In accordance with OAS stipulations, a National Coordination Secretariat (NCS) was established to spearhead and advance this project. The Secretariat was headed by Dr. Paulette Bethel, a former diplomat and comprised of a strong team of experts from my Ministry and relevant government agencies. Today, I wish to advise that due to current measures in place to mitigate the spread of COVID-­19, The Bahamas decided to withdraw its offer to host the Assembly. Discussions are now underway at the OAS regarding the date and venue of this year’s General Assembly.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker,\n",
            "With respect to candidacies, The Bahamas was extremely successful in its bid for re-­election to the Council of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO);; placing sixth among the twenty members elected to Category “C”. This is our highest position since our nearly thirty-­year membership of the Council. A dedicated\n",
            "team, comprising my Ministry and our overseas Missions, the Ministry of Transport and Local Government and Ambassador Denise Lewis Johnson and the team of The Bahamas Maritime Authority led the way for this notable achievement. This team continues with the work to get The Bahamas re-­elected in the next IMO election. Currently, much effort is being exerted toward the re-­election of Ms. Marion Bethel to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). Again, as a result of the safeguards in place against the COVID-­19 pandemic at the UN, the election which was scheduled to occur on 29 June 2020 in New York, has been tentatively rescheduled to September.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker,\n",
            "Members will recall that negotiations to delimit boundaries between The Bahamas and those neighbouring countries with whom we share maritime space, are ongoing. These countries include the United States (US), the Republic of Haiti and the UK on behalf of its overseas territory;; the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI). The Maritime Boundary Delimitation Committee within my Ministry continues to negotiate in the best interest of The Bahamas. The Committee was preparing to hold a fourth round of talks with the US;; however, the talks were delayed due to the COVID-­19 pandemic. In similar fashion, preparations are underway for the resumption of negotiations with the UK.\n",
            "My Ministry in collaboration with a number of stakeholders, including the Ministry of National Security and the Office of the Attorney General (OAG), is also in the process of drafting a Shipriders’ Agreement between The Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. The Bahamas stands to benefit from such an Agreement as it would allow for the extension of our Defence Force enforcement jurisdiction and subsequently impede the flow of illegal migration and poaching thus preventing (as best as possible) perpetrators from crossing our southern borders.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker,\n",
            "Human Rights Council\n",
            "In 2019, The Bahamas was elected as a member to the Human Rights Council (HRC) for the term 2019-­ 2021. The Human Rights Council is an inter-­governmental body within the United Nations system and is composed of forty-­seven (47) states which are responsible for the promotion and protection of all human\n",
            "rights globally. The Bahamas is one of the few Small Island Developing States (SIDS) currently serving on the Council and the first Member State of CARICOM to be elected to the body since its establishment in 2006. I am pleased to report that The Bahamas is seen as an invaluable member of the Council, and we use our membership to keep CARICOM and other small island developing states abreast of human rights issues that impact their lives.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker,\n",
            "The United Nations\n",
            "As a result of hurricane Dorian, we had the largest UN presence on the ground in The Bahamas than at any other given time in our history as an independent country. This enabled us to further leverage our engagement with the UN System. The Ministry convened a meeting with all UN personnel before they left the country and we have committed to work in a more cohesive manner with the objectives of rebuilding after Dorian and concretising UN relations in The Bahamas to ensure that we receive full benefits of our membership in the UN System.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker,\n",
            "As it relates to Passport and Consular Services\n",
            "Under the leadership of Ms. Siobhan Deane, Acting Chief Passport Officer, the Passport Office has made admirable progress during 2019, particular in the area of public relations. This is evident from the much improved missives of approbation the institution receives now on a daily basis. Much effort has been made to familiarize the public with the new Q-­Matic System, which lends to an easier, safe, fast and secure online application process, phase one of which—for the renewal of adult ePassports—was successfully launched on 9 December 2019. Indeed an historical milestone for the Ministry and by the extension, the country.\n",
            "In the result, there has been marked improvement in the turnaround time for collection. On average, persons applying for passports at the New Providence office and or online can collect their documents within five (5) to seven (7) working days after applying. Persons utilizing the expedited service can receive their passports within two (2) working days after applying. Likewise, auxiliary services that may be required under extenuating and emergency circumstances in New Providence remain available to the public.\n",
            "Applicants from the family islands and in other regions of the world can now receive their passports within ten (10) to fourteen (14) days following the application process. When using the expedited services, Family Island and elsewhere can receive their passports within 3-­4 days and 5-­7 days, respectively.\n",
            "Following a five (5) year interruption, passport services were resumed in our Beijing Mission in 2019. The restoration of these services was well received by our students and Bahamians residing in this region.\n",
            "For the period of July 2019 to May 2020, the Passport Office has enrolled thirty one thousand, one hundred (31,100) applicants, produced thirty three thousand and four (33,004) passports and issued thirty thousand, seven hundred and thirty four (30,734) books. The revenue generated for this time period was one million, three hundred and sixty nine thousand, five hundred and twenty five dollars (BDS1,369,525).\n",
            "Again, permit me to thank the staff of the Passport Office for the yeoman’s effort made to replace passports lost due to Dorian. In order to provide additional relief, fees for replacement passports were waived and documents were produced for collection within three (3) to four (4) working days. Today, I am pleased to report that the Grand Bahama Office resumed full services on 1 November 2019 and our Central Abaco Office resumed duties on 11 February 2020.\n",
            "We continue with our efforts in finalizing the logistical details for the establishment of satellite Passport Offices in Eleuthera, Inagua, Long Island and Exuma. Of note, the Passport Office Mobile Services remains operational for all family islands. The necessary network infrastructure and equipment are in place for Inagua and Exuma to allow passport services to be offered. However, travel to these islands to install the equipment was postponed due to the COVID-­19 pandemic.\n",
            "It is now critical to have the capacity to renew ePassports for minors online which will mitigate the volume of customers requiring such service during the upcoming (peak) summer season. My Ministry is currently in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) to ascertain the necessary logistics related to this process.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker,\n",
            "On 23 March 2020, the Passport Office was closed to the general public due to the COVID-­19 pandemic. Staff moved to work remotely and facilitated emergencies during this period. Staff are currently working on a rotational basis and the issuance section of the Passport Office is open to public for the hours of 9am – 1pm to allow individuals to collect their passports only;; the enrollment section of the office remains closed to the general public. Since re-­opening the issuance section of the office on 11 May, approximately seventeen hundred (1,700) passports were collected. Further, the online unit is fully operational and requires minimal interaction with the public. In the interest of staff health and safety, plexi-­glass will be installed (by 1 June) in the Passport Office in Grand Bahama and the office will resume gradual service that is similar to that of the New Providence office. Of note, passport services will resume in Abaco once the COVID-­19 measures are lifted.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker,\n",
            "Consular Division\n",
            "The Consular Division continues to work in collaboration with relevant Government Ministries and Agencies to facilitate deportation requests and assist with repatriation of foreign nationals. The Consular Division was instrumental in assisting overseas Missions with deportation and the return of one hundred and one (101) Bahamians from the US to The Bahamas during the period of July 2019 to May 2020. These persons have served sentences in US facilities for crimes which could range from drug offences, physical abuse and visa overstay.\n",
            "During the period of July 2019 to March 2020, the Consular Division assisted the Department of Immigration with the repatriation of one thousand, six hundred and sixty (1,660) foreign nationals to their homelands. This figure includes one thousand, six hundred and thirty three (1,633) Haitian nationals and twenty seven (27) persons from other countries.\n",
            "Further, the Division continues to facilitate Bahamians in distress in foreign countries in collaboration with our overseas Missions. For the period of July 2019 to May 2020, the Consular Division together with our overseas Missions assisted three hundred and sixty eight (368) Bahamians in this regard.\n",
            "For the first half of this budget year July 2019 to March 2020, the Consular Division Apostilled/Legalized six thousand and ninety three (6,093) documents which generated a revenue of one million, one hundred and seventy nine thousand, four hundred and sixty six dollars and eighty six cents. (BSD1,179,466.86).\n",
            "For the period of July 2019 to March 2020, two thousand, two hundred and forty one (2,241) visas were issued to foreign nationals with revenue generation of nine hundred and one thousand, one hundred and sixty two dollars (BSD901,162.00).\n",
            "Mr. Speaker,\n",
            "I put the general public on notice that the Ministry is currently working with the Ministry of Finance to introduce measures that will eliminate the use of cash at the Passport Office, the Consular Division and our overseas Missions.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker,\n",
            "With regards to the Office of the Spouse of the Prime Minister\n",
            "The Office of the Spouse of the Prime Minister (OSPM) continues with its effort toward in empowering women and girls through diverse projects and programmes. On 9 October 2019 and in commemoration with the UN International Day of the Girl Child, the office launched the country’s first Women and Girls Mentoring Coalition in partnership with the Ministry of Social Services, Ministry of Education, Science and Technology and the Ministry of Health. The official ceremony was held at Government House and greater than five hundred (500) young girls from thirteen (13) junior and senior high schools participated in this historic event. Since the launch of the coalition, the team has undertaken and successfully completed a number of projects.\n",
            "In response to the adverse impact of the COVID-­19 pandemic on many Bahamian families, the Office of the Spouse, in conjunction with mentors of the coalition, the Feeding Network and other organizations led several food distribution exercises during the months of March, April and May. In March, one hundred and sixty eight\n",
            "(168) families received food coupons (valued at $50) and during the months of April and May a total of seven hundred and sixty (760) families received food packages. In similar fashion, the office has provided assistance to many persons in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian. In September 2019, the office distributed\n",
            "back to school packages to displaced students that were housed in the Kendal Isaacs Gymnasium and hosted a two (2) day distribution event at the Fox Hill Community Centre to assist displaced teachers from Abaco and Grand Bahama.\n",
            "The office continues its collaboration with the Spouses of the Caribbean Leaders Action Network (SCLAN) and in January of this year, Mrs. Minnis was one of the keynote speakers at a two (2) day forum for adolescents which was hosted by the First Lady of Belize. Further, Mrs. Minnis has delivered motivational speeches and addressed diverse organizations and civic group during the past year including the International Women Forum which was held in The Bahamas in September 2019 at the Atlantis Resort, Paradise Island.\n",
            "The school mentoring programme which commenced in October 2018 has grown tremendously and during the past year Mrs. Minnis has delivered numerous motivational and educational talks relative to gender based violence, career paths and entrepreneurship to girls enrolled in junior and senior high schools in The Bahamas. It was intended that the programme and distribution of care packages be continued in six (6) family islands schools (namely Abaco, Grand Bahama, Exuma, Acklins, Mayaguana and San Salvador) during the first half of this year (2020);; however the programme was postponed due to the onset of the COVID-­19 pandemic.\n",
            "Of note, packages were already prepared and shipped for distribution to students and to date, some of the packages remain in the Office of the Prime Minister in Abaco pending distribution whenever possible.\n",
            "Despite the challenges with working remotely during the pandemic, the office continues it work with the coalition and has held monthly meetings via a virtual platform. In similar manner, work continues relative to the planning of several projects that are in the pipeline including a pending distribution of care packages for healthcare professionals, a student savings programme with local banks and a collaborative International Development Bank (IDB) funded project with SCLAN on gender based violence for both girls and boys.\n",
            "Most noteworthy, the office is currently in the infancy stages of developing a collaborative project with international donors for the renovation of the South Wing of the Children’s Ward at the Princess Margaret Hospital. Also in the pipeline, is the establishment of a four (4) week summer training programme in\n",
            "partnership with the coalition and Ministry of Agriculture Processing Plant Laboratory. This programme will involve training for fifteen (15) high school students relative to processing preserves (e.g. mango chutney, pepper sauce and jam) using locally grown produce and aims to induce entrepreneurship among young people while promoting the use of locally grown produce. The programme is set to begin in July pending the lift of measures for COVID-­19.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker,\n",
            "As it relates to the Ministry’s response plan during the COVID-­19 pandemic\n",
            "During the height of the COVID-­19 pandemic, requisite staff were identified to work remotely and provide essential services to the public. Most of the essential staff members were tasked with dual responsibilities which included serving as a focal point for a select Mission/s or Consulate/s. Heads of Missions were encouraged to direct all issues, new developments and reports for their jurisdiction to the assigned focal point for subsequent sharing with senior management. This process was implemented to ensure rapid response and action for pressing issues in the midst of a significantly reduced staff complement.\n",
            "In addition, the Permanent Secretary implemented virtual meetings (using zoom technology) to ensure continued efficient operation of the Ministry. Senior managers of the Ministry met daily to report on pertinent issues (both home and abroad) and develop strategic plans for continued execution of the work of the Ministry during the lingering COVID-­19 pandemic.\n",
            "Senior management of the Ministry ensured that staff (at home and abroad) were well informed through continuous dissemination of diverse forms of information;; including electronic mail, press releases and legislative orders. In an effort to remain consistent in public communications, senior management provided all Heads of Missions with standardized speaking points that can be easily adapted for the situation in a given jurisdiction.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker,\n",
            "As it relates to engagement with the international community and the handling Foreign nationals during the COVID-­19 pandemic\n",
            "The Ministry provided the diplomatic community and the honorary consular corps with information (on a regular basis) in accordance with the travel restrictions and Emergency Orders implemented by the Government of The Bahamas in light of the COVID-­19 pandemic. The Ministry also served as an intermediary between the diplomatic community and the Aviation Authority for the purpose of facilitating approvals for flight entry/clearance and the repatriation of foreign nationals (namely, German, Mexican, Italian, Canadian and British nationals). The Ministry also responded to a number of requests in relation to ship clearance.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker,\n",
            "As it relates to handling of Bahamian nationals stuck abroad during the COVID-­19 pandemic\n",
            "As the world has not experienced a pandemic of this magnitude, many countries (including The Bahamas) were without requisite policies for border closure and the management of dislocated citizens. In the absence of such policies/guidance notes, the Permanent Secretary and senior management adhered to existing Consular procedures and advised Bahamian nationals abroad to shelter in their current location and to contact the nearest Embassy, High Commission, Consulate General or Honorary Consul in their jurisdiction. Most noteworthy, my Ministry (through the Embassies and Consulates) ensured that distressed/dislocated Bahamian nationals received (and continue to receive) assistance as deemed necessary.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker,\n",
            "With respect to the repatriation of Bahamian nationals, permanent residents and work permit holders On Thursday 29 April 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was tasked with the responsibility of coordinating the repatriation process for Bahamian nationals, permanent residents and work permit holders that are currently dislocated abroad due to closure of the country’s border. To this end, a task force was established within the Ministry to spearhead and advance the work required for the repatriation process. Ministry officials conferred with senior personnel from relevant Government Ministries and Agencies (namely, Ministry of Tourism and Aviation, Office of the Prime Minister in Grand Bahama, National Airport Development Company (NAD), Royal Bahamas Police Force (RBPF), Royal Bahamas Defence Force (RBDF), Customs Department, Immigration Department, MOH and Bahamasair) to develop a repatriation plan that gave rise to a structured process. The task force recommended that the repatriation process be done in phases with the first phase\n",

On Friday 8 May 2020, a total of one hundred and eighty (183) Bahamian nationals and residents returned home during the country’s first repatriation exercise. Since this first exercise, the Ministry in collaboration with the aforementioned agencies have overseen0 three (3) additional exercises and facilitated the return of three hundred and eleven (311) persons. To date, a total of four hundred and ninety four (494) individuals have returned to the country and the Ministry continues its effort in this regard.\n",

            "With respect to the Ministry’s proposed 2020l2021 Budget\n",
            "In light of the country’s current economic forecast, my Ministry (like all other Ministries) is faced with a 20% cut in the 2020/2021 budget and cancellation of all new spending requests. This cut equates to a loss of BSD5.6 million in funds for fiscal year (FY) 2020/2021. The Ministry proposes that capital expenditure for FY2020/2021 will include refurbishment to the VIP lounge at the Lynden Pindling International Airport (LPIA), Head Office and Passport and Consular Offices. It is also intended that repairs be made to the Chancery and Residence in Washington and London and the final payment of BSD2.5 million be made to Canadian Bank note for eVisa and ePassport systems.\n",
            "Mr. Speaker,\n",
            "Even though we are faced with the arduous task of operating on a decreased budget for the FY2020/2021, I am happy to report that staff salaries (which equate to 35% of our total budget) are secured. In light of the current global economic climate, we anticipate a negative impact on revenue generation and project 60% of our proposed revenue. Nonetheless, we are determined to move forward in our quest to serve with excellence and have heralded that this upcoming fiscal year will be ‘the year that we make the most out of less’.\n",

            "March 1, 2021 — Barbados’ Prime Minister, the Honourable Mia Amor Mottley, QC, MP, delivered the keynote at the opening session of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) High-Level virtual meeting entitled, “Transformational Climate Financing for the Caribbean Region”. Prime Minister Mottley’s keynote was preceded by remarks by GCF Executive Director Yannick Glemarec. Other presenters included the Honourable John Antonio Briceño, Prime Minister of Belize; Her Excellency Diann Black-Layne, Antigua & Barbuda’s Climate Change Ambassador and current Chair of AOSIS; Dr. Colin Young, Executive Director of the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre (5Cs) and; Dr. Didacus Jules, Director-General of the OECS Commission.\n",
            "Transcript of the Prime Minister’s Keynote:\n",
            "[00:00:00] Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\n",
            "[00:00:01] Your Excellency, the Honourable John Briceño, Prime Minister of Belize.\n",
            "[00:00:05] His Excellency, the Honourable Dr. Bharrat Jagdeo, Vice President of Guyana.\n",
            "[00:00:10] Mr. Yannick Glemarec, the Executive Director, GCF.\n",
            "[00:00:14] Ambassador Diann Black-Layne of Antigua and Barbuda, and Chair AOSIS.\n",
            "[00:00:19] Dr. Colin Young, Executive Director of the Caribbean Community Climate Change Center.\n",
            "[00:00:23] Dr. Didacus Jules, Director-General of the OECS Commission.\n",
            "[00:00:27] Distinguished friends and colleagues, all.\n",
            "[00:00:30] Good morning. And for those who might be elsewhere, good night. Or very late night for those participating, I believe in Korea.\n",
            "[00:00:39] Normally you would be here in this region with us for this occasion and we hope to be welcoming you again very soon.\n",
            "[00:00:47] I want to thank Mr. Glemarec and the Green Climate Fund for continuing to prioritize Caribbean Small Island Developing States through this GCF Transformational Climate Financing for the Caribbean Region event, and for inviting me to share some thoughts, just a few thoughts during this opening session.\n",
            "[00:01:06] Our dialog these days has regrettably been overtaken by COVID-19, not just the public health response and what we need to do to save lives, but also the current and future livelihoods, making sure that recovery is less about building-back, because in many respects we shouldn’t want to be repeating the approaches of the past, as so many of us have said – but we want to build forward better.\n",
            "[00:01:30] And as we acknowledge by our presence here today, this pandemic is not the only global threat we face as at the same time the climate crisis continues, having said that, to be more critical than ever. In fact, as I’ve had occasion to point to just a few days ago in another regional forum, the two C’s of COVID and the Climate Crisis are not the only ones that trouble us in this region. The Caribbean region faces simultaneous threats of chronic NCDs, which has compounded the reality for our people with COVID. We also face, regrettably, the other public health disease of crime in too many of its forms. And then, of course, the fifth and final C to which I have referred always is common for many of us, which is the consequences of colonialism, which cause us to indeed strengthen or organize action around securing reparations, given the absence of a development compact upon our nations, becoming independent.\n",
            "[00:02:35] Dr. Young, I acknowledge that in this context, there’s a slightly different understanding of 5Cs, and I know you would appreciate that when I therefore refer to those 5Cs just now. This is not an attempt, believe you me, to appropriate, but only just to keep us focused on the challenge and the need for true global partnership and actions in response.\n",
            "[00:02:59] Our island nations and most of the countries of the Caribbean basin are small, yes, but our region is large, particularly in its diversity and its historic contribution to global economic wealth as it now exists, though held by others at the time, of course, and not by us.\n",
            "[00:03:17] Because of our small terrestrial size, we are it seems, difficult for many to see, literally, and as I’ve said often too much, otherwise. And even when we are seen, it is similarly difficult for many to justify action, based on economic arguments of scale.\n",
            "[00:03:37] So perhaps it helps to see us as predominantly countries of water first, as well as land. Barbados, for example, has an exclusive economic zone that is 424 times the size of its terrestrial space. We are truly more blue than green. The Caribbean Sea is the second largest sea in the world, with our region spanning the expanse of water between the South American mainland and the southern tip of the United States of America. We are in one of the most active tropical cyclone regions of the world.\n",
            "[00:04:16] This places us squarely on the frontlines of the climate fight, quite literally. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that given our vulnerability, our focus in the climate fight has not only been on encouraging all countries to increase their mitigation ambition, including our own, but also on adaptation and building climate resilience in a crisis that is truly not of our making, but by which we are disproportionately impacted. And we don’t tire of saying so because our reality is very much in front of us.\n",
            "[00:04:53] The same might be said of this pandemic, which is of course, of no one’s making, but which sees some of us less able to access the critical therapeutics and vaccines needed to protect our citizens because of the size of our countries and therefore the scope of our power. We confront the failure of the market daily with respect to this pandemic. Regrettably, we seem not to be able to acknowledge that until every country is safe, no country is safe. And that does not in any way diminish the efforts that each country must take to be safe. But it cannot replace the collective multilateral action to ensure that the global community is a beneficiary of vaccines across the world. COVID does not detect geography or nationality.\n",
            "[00:05:47] And similarly, if the global community does not act quickly to make up for delays in financing commitments under the Paris Agreement with respect to climate, climate refugees fleeing imminent threat of sea level rise and devastation from disaster will be every country’s responsibility. And I speak to you this morning having had to dispatch the Minister of Maritime Affairs and Blue Economy to parts of the West Coast in my own country, where the sea has already taken away the sea walls of a few properties and where therefore their experience with the climate crisis is real, not conjecture.\n",
            "[00:06:27] This is why my friends, Barbados and AOSIS have called for more financing dedicated to adaptation. This is not meant to decrease the amount of finance dedicated to mitigation or to reduce the commitment to a small island developing states, to the mitigation targets under our new NDCs. We call for a significant increase in overall climate finance.\n",
            "[00:06:52] Keeping warming below 1.5 degrees will require tremendous investment in both the developed and developing world to transition energy and transport sectors to renewable energy. And the time is running out on us, largely because our reports received, show that already we have gone beyond 1.2; we’ve gone to 1.2 degrees above the climate, the pre-industrial sectors.\n",
            "[00:07:21] In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that global mitigation costs would be around 2.4 trillion dollars per year, and a more recent report last December by the Boston Consulting Group and Global Financial Markets Association raised that estimate to 3 to 5 trillion dollars per year; numbers that we can’t even assimilate in the region. Adaptation costs in developing countries, currently estimated at 70 billion dollars per year, is expected to reach up to 300 billion dollars a year by the end of the decade in 2030.\n",
            "[00:08:03] We welcome the positive signs that the size of adaptation projects funded by the multilateral funds serving the Paris agreement, whether it be the Adaptation Fund, the Green Climate Fund or the Global Environment Facility they are all increasing. According to the latest Adaptation Gap report, since 2017, 21 new projects have had a value of more than US$25 million dollars. And we want to applaud the Green Climate Fund for its commitment to allocate at least 50 percent now of its pledged funds over the first replenishment period up to December 2023 to adaptation. This is news to our ears.\n",
            "[00:08:45] Barbados has seen the evidence of this commitment by the GCF both in the size and scope of our water sector sustainability project being executed in partnership with the 5Cs and in the readily expressed enthusiasm of the programmatic approach to resilience that we have taken in our own Roofs to Reefs project. For us, Roofs to Reefs is our sustainable development model for the next decade at least, and it reinforces the findings of the reports I referenced, that addressing the climate crisis requires not only investment at scale, but financial instruments that mean that this dual health and climate crisis do not turn into a debt crisis, especially for middle-income, small island developing states like my own and so many other in the AOSIS.\n",
            "[00:09:41] Our Roofs to Reefs program has already identified at least US$1 billion of integrated projects across the housing, energy, waste and water sectors that would represent a truly transformative approach to lasting resilience – that would prepare us for our future in a way that our past has not done. In this program, you will find not just adaptation measures, but those investments that are required to also allow us to meet our target by 2030 of being fossil fuel free. This is our mitigation target.\n",
            "[00:10:22] We further accept that these partnerships are needed beyond our bilateral relationships with institutions like the GCF. The private sector and the private finance initiatives need to be brought into these efforts. We have therefore been promoting the following: debt for nature swaps, natural disaster and pandemic clauses in multilateral financing and other debt instruments that have to be issued going forward.\n",
            "[00:10:50] We are already, as you know, the biggest issuer of natural disaster clauses in Barbados, as we prepared for this moment when we sought to restructure our debt three years ago. A vulnerability index is needed that removes GDP as a central consideration for accessing concessional finance and prioritizes climate and debt vulnerability. I’m sure many of you are tired of hearing me talk those words as you were tired of hearing almost every previous Caribbean leader for the last 30 years refer to them. But vulnerability remains at the core of what we face as developing nation-states and the absence of the global community to appreciate that, and to put it into play such that we can truly be given the opportunity to access what we need at the global level, based on our vulnerability, as opposed to indices that have no relevance to our real needs going forward.\n",
            "[00:11:51] The restructuring of the pandemic and the possible climate crisis related debt, I should say, not restructuring, reprofiling of the pandemic and possibly climate crisis debt. Why? Because debt incurred between January last year and whenever the pandemic finishes, literally needs to be refinanced into longer-term instruments so that we may be able to resume the development trajectory and we may be able to put ourselves in a place in order to access the funding necessary for adaptation and resilience in particular in our region, given the fact that the climate crisis has not paused in spite of the presence of the pandemic.\n",
            "[00:12:37] My friends, the Global Commission on Adaptation in 2019 estimated that US$1.8 trillion investment in adaptation measures would bring about US$7.1 trillion dollars in avoided costs and other benefits. In other words, just about four times the benefit.\n",
            "[00:13:00] Despite this, it remains more difficult to attract private sector investment to adaptation projects than it does to mitigation. And this places tremendous pressure on public financing for adaptation; financing that can then not be used on key well-being responsibilities of the state like health and education, or the other aspects of the development trajectory that we set out upon independence to achieve for our people. This is disturbing.\n",
            "[00:13:34] Equally, in 2009 in Copenhagen, developed countries promised to mobilize US$100 billion dollars over and above the ODA promised under the Monterrey Consensus for Climate Finance. That amount, developing countries agreed to allow both grants and loans to be accounted at face value rather than on a grant equivalent basis. Oxfam in 2020 estimated that donors reported US$59.5 billion dollars per year on average in 2017 and 2018.\n",
            "[00:14:13] But the true value of support for climate action may well have been as little as US$19 to 22 billion dollars per year once loan repayments, interest and other forms of overreporting were stripped out. I want to repeat myself. The true value of support for climate action in spite of that promise made in 2009 for a US$100 billion dollars a year over ODA, the true value of support has been in the vicinity of US$19 to 22 billion dollars per year once you’ve taken out the loan repayments, the interest and the other forms of reporting.\n",
            "[00:14:55] Alongside a new financial architecture, there are other efforts to be undertaken including agreement on internationally accepted methodologies to quantify the significant roles of the Caribbean Sea and the associated reefs, seagrass beds and mangroves in carbon sequestration, which would allow our roles in the mitigation fight to be recognized alongside those of our larger neighbours.\n",
            "[00:15:23] My friends, as we meet in this regional context, we acknowledge that there is a role for functional cooperation among our countries, especially in developing the knowledge and financial instruments required to be transformational and holistic, and at a scale commensurate with the challenges faced. However, any regional approaches must be owned and must be led by countries who drive the demand and the execution, rather than being consulted on the basis of a fully-developed concept in which they’ve had little or no voice. Let us not ourselves perpetuate the invisibility of our region, of which we often accuse others. But let us ensure that we continue to strive in partnership, that we give voice to our people and inside our countries, to our communities, because we know deeply that if we act collectively, if we act decisively, we can win this battle. But as is showing with COVID, if we allow time to become our enemy and if we allow complacency to be our ally, then we shall not win this most important of battles. For what we fight is for our very existence in this our land that has shaped us to be who we are.\n",
            "[00:16:53] I trust and pray that your deliberations will bring us that much closer to winning battles that we should have won long ago. In particular, that with respect to the issue of vulnerability. If we have to set but one goal over the course of the next two years to be able to secure, then the most important role is to settle the issue of vulnerability criteria, because that is the only thing that is going to unlock access to oxygen, namely finance, for us to be able to fight our own battles.\n",
            "[00:17:29] I wish you all the very best in your deliberations. Thank you very much.\n",

            "Ladies and gentlemen today is a good day for Portmore and Jamaica.\n",
            "Today marks a historic moment in the history of Portmore as we gather in the heart of the new city, the new parish under the radiant Jamaican sun, not just to inaugurate a park but to witness the birth off an oasis. I am happy to officially commence the build out of the highly anticipated Climate Smart Park spanning 21.5 acres to be named The Portmore Resilience Park.\n",
            "The development of lot 26 at the Portmore Town Centre, will see the establishment of a multifaceted recreational and wellness park catering to the people of Portmore. The park will be for the benefit and use of all citizens of Portmore and visitors. It will be free to enter. We expect the park to be completed in September 2025. The contractors are here, Pave-Con Limited. This is a warning, September 2025. This is a massive investment totalling 4.4 billion Jamaican dollars; all of this is coming from the budget of the government of Jamaica. We are not borrowing to do this.\n",
            "Today, I want to speak to you as if I’m speaking to my family. I know that in your minds, as you look on this ceremony and you look at this piece of land that has been here variously described as a dust bowl, a health hazard and so forth, that there are some psychological blocks to messages that I will deliver. I want you, for a moment, to take down those psychological blocks and listen carefully to all the messages that I will deliver here today. You can always go back and reanalyze, fact check and determine whether or not what I say is true, it’s accurate. You don’t have to accept it because your context, your fundamental principles and beliefs may lead you to other conclusions, but I want you to listen carefully, absorb, analyze, rationalize, contextualize, and internalize.\n",
            "There have been many calls about how the government should spend the dividends of an improved economy. Some people believe we should just give away the money. Yes, that was a part of the discussion a year or two ago in parliament, we should just spend the money. This government believes in the establishment of an economy that cares and you don’t build an economy that cares by merely giving away.\n",
            "You don’t build an economy that cares on handouts. It may be necessary to have what is called cash transfers but usually we want those cash transfers to be conditional. If we give you some cash, then we expect you to send your children to school. If we give you some cash, then we expect you to have proper health seeking behaviour and that is well established in welfare economics. And that is indeed the fundamental principle for our PATH Programme, that when we do give social welfare benefits, it is usually in exchange for some social behaviour change that promotes growth, not just give away for no reason, or to spend on projects that don’t give a high social return.\n",
            "The caring economy that we are building here today is exemplified by this park because what the government is doing is taking the increased productivity of every one of you that sits here because the economy can only grow unless your community economy grows, unless your household grows, and unless you the workers and entrepreneurs produce more. That’s how the economy grows, so if there is more revenue, it comes from your greater output. You hire us as government to oversee this increased output and make a determination as to what is the best thing to spend it on. Of course, we always listen to what the people say and the people of Portmore have always been saying we need safe, well-built social spaces and they have been saying this for a long time. Portmore with almost 200,000 residents does not have a park.\n",
            "Your mayor is looking on me and I’m reading his eyes and I’m listening. You don’t have a hospital. You need a proper, well-defined market space. We have started that and there are some other critical things that Portmore would need and your government, in building the caring economy, has started to address your need for a proper health facility. So, you would recall yesterday I broke ground for the upgrading of the infrastructure of the Spanish Town Hospital, the hospital built 70 years ago, we’re going to put up a six-story building, which will make it one of the most modern health facilities in Jamaica.\n",
            "And that is how we give back the productivity of the nation to the people by improving your health care. That’s how we build the economy that cares about you and in Portmore, we are going to be building a type five health centre. Type five health centre is just one step below a hospital. It will basically offer all the services of a hospital except some of the critical clinical surgeries, but then in a matter of time that can be upgraded. And we have already budgeted for it, and it has been announced in addition to one that we’re going to do in Old Harbour and another in St Jago Park. So that is how we are using the dividends from proper management of the economy to care for the people.\n",
            "So, this park is part of our caring agenda. It’s part of saying to you, look, we know you need a place that you can jog around in the mornings, that you can just stroll around, that you can spread a picnic blanket and just chill with your friends or just gather in a safe and clean place or have a concert. You know how that can just reduce the tension in addition to reduce the hypertension. Yes, that is how you build the care.\n",
            "4.5 acres of the 26 acres will be reserved for a transportation hub. Now, I know that there are concerns about a transportation centre, notice I didn’t use that term. And it is a much smaller footprint. It is a transportation hub. In any event, once we put up the park and it becomes a focal area, a destination, you’re going to need to make provision for transportation so when we are planning, we think about those things. We don’t want people stopping off in the road in order to get to the park or coming from the park, crossing the road to get to transportation. Let’s do it orderly. Let’s plan for it. Let’s manage it so there will be a transportation hub there. And it will be designed in such a way that it does not take away from the aesthetic of the park because we know what happens in our transportation hubs. It will not happen in this park.\n",
            "21.5 acres will remain, and 18.5 acres will be used for the park itself. The original concept was only to use 15 acres for the park and the rest would have been for the transportation centre. We’re not going with that model. However, we will use 2.75 acres for commercial spaces, and I’ll tell you a little bit more about that.\n",
            "The park will be named the Resilience Park and that is in recognition of the indomitable, that’s the word in my script here, but it is more than just indomitable, refusing to be defeated, but it is the ability to recover even after a tragedy, even after a catastrophe, even if we are defeated in the battle, we will recover to win the war. And not just recover but recover stronger and that’s the idea behind Resilience.\n",
            "There is a deeper meaning to the building of the infrastructure. When Prime Minister Patterson did Emancipation Park, it was in honour of our struggle to freedom. We build a monument to that, and it has served Jamaica well. It is iconic, people go there to exercise, to recreate, to entertain. It has added significant value to Kingston and St Andrew. I had the privilege of building one such park and I believe I’ve gone one step better, but we built the park in Montego Bay using it as well to establish another important principle and definition of the Jamaican people, that of harmony.\n",
            "So, we took a piece of land that was previously called ‘dump up beach’, which just reflected the negative side of our culture and history where we would take a beach and dump it up with rubbish and all kinds of things and we changed it into probably the finest park in the Caribbean. If you haven’t had a chance to go there, I urge you to go there. When you talk about people spreading their blankets and having picnics, that is what happens at that park every Sunday. It is a fantastic piece of social infrastructure and I feel that it has changed how people interact with each other; it’s a lovely facility. And today I have the privilege once more to start the construction of another such park, which we know will have a signal impact on the minds and psyche and behaviour of Jamaicans, the Resilience Park in Portmore.\n",
            "We have a few more parks to come. The idea is that every parish in Jamaica should have one such park, so I’ve tasked the UDC to actively search for lands in all the parishes that we have to create such parks. And you know, I would like to be the prime minister that builds a park in every parish, and we can do it very quickly because we now have the model to do it. UDC has developed the internal capacity to do it and we are developing the administrative wherewithal to get it done so we will be doing more parks for Jamaica and that is part of building the caring economy.\n",
            "There are some existing parks that we need to pay attention to. There is one park, which was not named by virtue of a principle or a cultural feature of our people, but still, it does represent a fundamental principle of our people, a fundamental epic of our people. It was named after a colonial landowner, Hope Gardens. You see how that name fits in nicely? And for those of you who have been there recently, you would agree that it is in need of some care. The Cabinet recently discussed it, and we have put in place some preliminary plans as to how to approach it, so you will hear more about what we intend to do for that very important national asset of Hope Gardens. In my budget presentation to come, you’ll also hear about the next park, or the next two or three parks that we intend to build.\n",
            "So, this park will have soft and hard landscapes, meaning that some areas will be grassed, and some areas will have other materials for surface. It will have sporting facilities. It will have event spaces. When we say events spaces, possibly an amphitheatre or other such arrangements. I said commercial spaces before and the distinction with Emancipation Park and Harmony Park is that Harmony Park has commercial spaces. It gives a little bit more service to the park, a little bit more functionality and it works very well but more importantly, it helps to subsidize the management cost of the park. It will have public restrooms, but these won’t be like public restrooms that exist in other areas. These restrooms, you could rest in them.\n",
            "Obviously, because it is built on the concept of resilience and an important part of the idea of climate change is resiliency, the ability of not just a people, but of the environment to recover from an environmental shock, particularly the built environment so we will be employing green technology. And that green technology- I see Fitz and Leon look at me when I use the term green technology. Don’t worry about it. When the former minister of local government in 2014, you know who that was? When he was opening or breaking ground or whatever it was, putting up the sign for the park in 2014, the then minister said we must green up the place and then quickly corrected himself. And I was like, why would he correct himself? Because yes, the truth is we must green up the place. We must make the place. You remember at Emancipation Park, you were there. Yes, we were sharing a private joke at Emancipation Park when it was being opened. We also had a similar exchange.\n",
            "So, yes, we will be using smart technology and green technology so solar will be used right throughout to ensure that we have electricity to operate our pumps and lights and so forth and to ensure that we can have proper irrigation so that the park can indeed be green and verdant in its appearance. We will have sufficient parking and we will pay close attention to security. So even though you will be able to enter free of cost, the security arrangements will be such that you will be required to comply with them in order to enter so it will not be a free for all to enter the park. We know how parks fail. Even the best facilities fail if you do not guarantee security for the users. When people come into this park, they must feel free. Nobody’s going to harass them to sell them anything. Nobody’s going to harass them to beg them anything. Nobody’s going to steal the stuff that you put down. No, this is a park where we come to relax and recreate.\n",
            "We will even have electric vehicle charging stations here. We will be making provision for conservation, including rainwater harvesting and we expect that we will have about 75,000 gallons of water that we will be able to harvest from the 26 acres. We will have a 700-meter jogging trail around the park, and we will use 70 percent recycled materials for this. A large part of the park is educational so right around the park you will have signs and interactive equipment that will give you information about climate change, about conservation, about recycling, and so forth. The intention is to use the park to change the attitudes of Jamaicans towards waste disposal, protecting the environment, and increasing the understanding of climate change.\n",
            "There is no doubt that this park will create significant economic activity in Portmore, and it will increase the property value of all the properties around the park without question. But most importantly, I think it will improve how each resident of Portmore feels about themselves and their community.\n",
            "We expect that the park will create about 400 jobs and 200 indirect jobs during its construction phase and during its operational phase we will have about 70 direct jobs and 30 indirect jobs as a result of the park.\n",
            "In terms of the commercial spaces, we will have 14 designated commercial spaces for commercial activities and 18 kiosks, smaller spaces for operations. So, the big question that the mayor asks, when are we going to start? I understand because this park in particular has been the subject of many starts and stops. Thankfully, none under me. And I’ve said before that I find myself having to divide my time into completing what others started but did not finish in addition to carrying through the things that I have started. And that is not a complaint because that is life. There is no original idea. Only ideas yet to be rediscovered.\n",
            "I’ve always said the brain is not all in one head, so thoughts are all over. Everybody has thoughts, right? But what leaders do is, good leaders are able to see the good idea and implement. I know that the mayor went to great lengths to remind you that it started under his administration, long time ago it started; sign erected, my record is that over 160 trees were planted around the perimeter, I’m searching for one. There was a commitment for a pairing with a sister city. Look, the point to note here as I speak to all of the citizens of Portmore regarding how government works, all governments must come to you with a manifesto of plans, things that we’re going to do and you have to assess, can they do it? It’s very good to talk rhetoric, promises, glowing words, but the real test is who delivers, who gets the job done. That’s what it comes down to.\n",
            "The flaw in the political economy of Jamaica, how we make decisions, is that we celebrate the lovely words. We celebrate the rhetoric. We say “oh, him can speak good.” We celebrate the announcement and then having given of ourselves to promises, when we are disappointed, we turn away from the system and say “cho, mi can bother” when what we must do before is what I asked you to do when I started. Take down the psychological and mental blocks, listen very carefully to what is being said, fact check it, contextualize it, put it against your own values and principles, and if it doesn’t align then you make your decision.\n",
            "We are here today with a ceremony which is important to mark the start of the project which will begin, ground will be broken. The contractor is here with me, and this is now a serious warning. The 5th of February, they should begin hoarding the site meaning putting up the fencing around the site to secure the site, and thereafter work will begin. So, if the contractor knows what I know, it better start the 1st of February. So that is the beginning date, and we expect to be completed by September 2025; that’s the objective.\n",
            "You have been a lovely audience and I have just a few more words to say to you. You would have heard quite a bit about Portmore becoming a parish. Let me immediately say that any change in the physical boundaries of a political geographical area will result in a change in voting outcomes, quite possibly, but that doesn’t mean that you should not change political geographical boundaries. Indeed, there is a standard process engaged in a routine way by the electoral office, the electoral commission, where they look at constituencies and determine whether or not the population in those constituencies fall below a minimum threshold and then they go and there has been even attempts to say some constituencies should not exist because their population is below the threshold. Almost on a routine basis, PD lines are changed, constituency boundaries are changed; that’s just the nature of political administration. That’s just it.\n",
            "So, the government seeking to create a new political administration for Portmore has nothing to do with trying to gain a political advantage. Let me make that clear. Now, I’ve used political in two senses. One sense is the contest for power and the other sense is the participation of the people in the administration of their affairs. Portmore has reached the point and has reached that point long ago where we must now provide for the proper administration of its affairs, it’s economic, social, cultural, infrastructure, security, all the local affairs.\n",
            "And while Portmore has evolved on its own, government really set this in motion. The moment that government policy, starting in the 60s, decided to build out Portmore as a housing estate and have a large mass of people residing here and then through petitions from the people would have made provisions of lands for town centres, provision of lands for park, provisions of land for hospital, provision of lands for market, several provisions of lands for what could only be described as everything necessary to give it its own political administration. It evolved to the point where George Lee, former mayor, God bless his soul, recognize this and lobby this government to make Portmore a municipality. So, the understanding that Portmore is evolving, developing its own economic, social and cultural identity and should therefore have its own political administration is not in question because a former administration already established that by establishing Portmore as a municipality.\n",
            "Now, bear with me a little bit. Why is it that we have parishes? How did the parishes come about? You know, there’s a sense in us that well, this is how I saw, and this is how I’ll leave it. The division of the country for administrative purposes into parishes began as a colonial vestige. It started out of how the colonial powers administered their own country by dividing up the administration of their own country into parishes that were associated with the church of their state. So, the Church of England would have a massive church in an area with people who go to that church, that’s the parish. The vestry of the church managed the pastoral and sometimes municipal affairs so at that time, the governance of the country was literally run by the church, hence ministers of government. And we continued with this right throughout.\n",
            "After 1865, the Morant Bay Rebellion, the colonial powers were forced to confront the brutal conditions in Jamaica, and they had to examine whether or not the institutions that were in place were actually serving the people of the country. And they decided that it wasn’t, and they changed the geographical administrative boundaries of the country and started to put in place mechanisms to properly define those administrative boundaries to give people greater political participation, including the formation of a constabulary force.\n",
            "Now, from that period, several of our townships started to emerge and many of our institutions started to emerge. Portmore has reached a point now where the administration of your affairs is really not done from Spanish Town. I am certain that Mayor Thomas will tell you that. And by the way, there is no way that Spanish Town can come and administer your affairs here. You wouldn’t allow it because in yourself you know that Portmore is evolving into its own personality.\n",
            "Now, the flip side to it is that in the current structure Portmore councillors get to vote on the affairs of the other areas of the parish. And even councillors on the other side have quietly complained and whispered about that so all we are trying to do is to move to the logical next step, that’s it, so there’s nothing to fear. So, the issue at play here is whether or not we’re going to do this in a local government election. No, I said it Sunday, I’ll say it again clearly.\n",
            "Our bill is ready to go to Parliament. We were ready for a little while now. We will not take it to Parliament. We will probably go to Parliament, we’ll table it, but we will not pass it because there is no way that we could seek to establish a parish and it be clouded in political accusations. No, we would never do that, and I want the people of Portmore to be assured of that.\n",
            "Now, there is another area in Jamaica where its own administrative personality is emerging and which we will have to consider some change in how their affairs are administered and that is in Negril. And you will understand that in Negril, the town of Negril has grown so it has grown out of Westmoreland into Hanover, and it is now creating a problem as to which municipality has charge over its development. So, these are things that happen as populations grow, as countries grow, and we shouldn’t be afraid of it. We should embrace it as part of the change and that is how we as Jamaican start to take responsibility for our own future and destiny.\n",
            "So, we need to put aside the political fears and look forward to the brighter future that is in front of us. Embrace it and work with it. So, ladies and gentlemen, today is a great day. Today is a day when we unite the nation around a fundamental ethos of the Jamaican people, and that is resilience, the ability to recover from hardship and recover stronger.\n",
            "Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the new Resilience Park which will begin official construction in February on the fifth.\n",

            "Tomorrow, 1stOctober 2019 will mark 70 years since Chairman Mao proclaimed the founding of the People’s Republic of China in Tiananmen Square. Excellency, I am truly delighted to join in this evening’s commemorative event and bring warm greetings and heartiest congratulations on behalf of the Government and people of Jamaica.\n",
            "National Day celebrations are always special, but this 70th Anniversary bears particular significance to the 1.3 billion people of China. It presents the people of China, and indeed the world, with an opportunity to reflect on and to showcase China’s extraordinary journey, its challenges, achievements and its aspirations for the next decades.\n",
            "To say that the People’s Republic of China has made strides in its development since opening up to the outside world would certainly be an understatement. Very few countries can claim to have achieved the levels of outstanding growth recorded by some of China’s provinces, and the country as a whole.\n",
            "Indeed, since its founding, the People’s Republic of China has made an indelible mark on almost every sphere of human endeavour, including in the arts, medicine, education, economics, engineering, science and technology, to name a few.\n",
            "As a result, the world is increasingly looking to China as a key driver of global economic development, and a partner in addressing common challenges.\n",
            "In the current global environment, these are certainly not the easiest of tasks. However, with the resilience and indomitable spirit that is characteristic of the Chinese people, and the strategic and wise guidance demonstrated by China’s leaders, its national ambitions are being realised.\n",
            "Marcus Garvey made the profound statement that “A people without the knowledge of their past history, origin and culture is like a tree without roots”. Of course, he would not have realized then how much that philosophical truth would have been reflected in the way in which the Chinese people have created a society, economy and country whose roots are firmly embedded in their rich history and culture. That strong foundation will undoubtedly continue to strengthen its current status and sustain its upward thrust for growth and productivity.\n",
            "Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\n",
            "At this time of celebration, I welcome the opportunity to also reflect on the 47 year old special relationship between Jamaica and China. Certainly, Jamaica’s connections with China go a long way back. Since the arrival of the first Chinese settlers, one hundred and sixty-five years ago, Chinese presence and culture, including certain culinary traditions, have become a part of the fabric of Jamaica. Chinese participation in the evolution of Jamaica’s development long precedes the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1972 and is truly reflected in our national motto “Out of Many, One People”.\n",
            "At the inter-governmental level, against the background of our early and longstanding commitment to the “One China Policy”, Jamaica has enjoyed excellent collaboration with China that has been underpinned by a philosophy of mutual respect and shared gains. Our friendship has blossomed and continues to bear fruit through vibrant cooperation activities that span a gamut of national endeavour.\n",
            "In the true spirit of solidarity, win-win cooperation and a commitment to shared prosperity and development, Jamaica and China pursed extensive cooperation activities this year in several areas.\n",
            "In education the Chinese government awarded a total of 13 scholarships to our young people and offered some 50 seminars for the 2019/2020 academic period. These actions have contributed significantly to Jamaica’s human resource capacity building efforts.\n",
            "In health; we are truly grateful for the Bright Journey Ophthalmic Mission that visited Jamaica in April this year and conducted free of cost, some 515 cataract surgeries to improve the vision and well-being of our people. I am pleased to let you know that we intend to extend this kind of success through the creation of an MOU on Cooperation in Health.\n",
            "In sport, the Jamaica China Technical Assistance Sport Coaching Project entered its 2nd year of implementation, and I am pleased to share that this summer, a 138-member delegation comprising Jamaican coaches and athletes visited China to further develop their skills in their respective disciplines. If you think Jamaica was stopping at bobsleigh or ice hockey, watch out world here come……!\n",
            "In the area of infrastructure, we have completed numerous major projects, most notably highways in rural areas and upgraded roadways in the corporate area. You will agree, I am sure, that these projects have really transformed travel and facilitated the ease with which we can travel across the island, particularly to the northern and western parishes.\n",
            "Other projects are in train – such as the Western Jamaica Children’s Hospital and our soon to be handed-over Foreign Ministry building on the Kingston waterfront. Some projects are about nearly ready for launching such as the Southern Coastal Highway Improvement Project, which will revolutionise growth and development particularly in the eastern parishes of St. Thomas and Portland.\n",
            "A significant area of bilateral engagement this year was also the signing of the Belt and Road Memorandum of Understanding. Within that framework our two countries will forge further bonds based on a new model of international development cooperation, promoting broad and inclusive ‘connectivity’.\n",
            "As we build out the implementation process for the Belt and Road Initiative, we are clear in our mutual commitment to win-win results, and will advance the priorities of the Government of Jamaica through a responsible and strategic partnership that will yield tangible benefits to the Jamaican people.\n",
            "These are only some of the deliverables of 2019, and we are confident that the Jamaica/China partnership will continue to flourish in the years ahead.\n",
            "In early November, Prime Minister Andrew Holness will lead Jamaica’s delegation to the China International Import Exhibition in Shanghai, where Jamaica has been designated as a Guest Country of Honour, of which they are only five. We welcome and appreciate this special privileged status, and will use this opportunity to showcase Jamaica’s culture and tourism product, increase investment in Jamaica and strengthen trade and commercial ties. Already we are expanding exports to China, particularly with the recent signing of the Protocol on the Importation of Frozen Lobster from Jamaica, by China.\n",
            "This Visit to China will also be an occasion to reinforce our partnership and elevate our relations to an even higher level.\n",
            "Ambassador Tian\n",
            "It has been just over a year since you assumed your ambassadorial role in Jamaica, and your impact has certainly been felt through your strong commitment to furthering our on-going bilateral engagement at multiple levels. Today, therefore, we convey our deep appreciation to you for the hard work you do for both your country, and for the people of Jamaica.\n",
            "Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\n",
            "On this spectacular occasion, please join me in raising your glasses in a Toast in celebration of the platinum anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, to the sustained prosperity of the people of China and to the continued strong bonds of friendship between Jamaica and China!\n",

            "As you know, since my Government assumed office last August, we have spared no effort to ensure the reversal of the severe and punitive conditions created by five years of misrule and mismanagement by the APNU/AFC dictatorship.\n",
            "Through our 2020 and 2021 budgets, we removed the Value-Added Tax (VAT) on water and electricity, as well as on basic food items, basic household necessities, and on medical and educational supplies. We reduced water tariffs by five percent, and reduced by 50 percent licence fees that had been increased since 2014. We also moved to make homeownership and home construction more affordable by removing the VAT on basic construction materials, increasing the ceilings on low-income mortgage loans from $8 million to $12 million and on loans granted by the New Building Society from $12 million to $15 million, and doubling the ceiling on loans eligible for mortgage interest relief from $15 to $30 million. We also reduced the cost of connectivity by taking off the VAT on data for residential and individual use and on cellular phones.\n",
            "In order to reduce the cost of doing business and to create jobs for all Guyanese, we removed the VAT on heavy machinery and equipment, removed corporate income taxes on companies investing in the education and health sectors, and reduced land rental charges back to 2014 levels. The latter measure alone put $1.4 billion back into the hands of farmers.\n",
            "More recently, I announced two major sets of interventions aimed at relieving the suffering faced by farmers and households as a result of the floods of May-June 2021, as well as to ease the impact of imported freight charges on the cost of living. In the first set of measures, I announced a $7.8 billion package of assistance to farmers and households to help get them back on their feet and help bolster production in the wake of the devastating floods they faced. The pay-out of this package will start later this week. In the second set of measures I announced last week, I introduced a cap on the freight charges used to calculate taxes on imports. This measure will allow for a saving of $4.8 billion by consumers and businesses.\n",
            "Other measures that my Government has implemented since we assumed office include an increase in old-age pensions from $20,500 monthly to $25,000 monthly and in public assistance from $9,000 to $12,000 monthly. These two measures alone have injected an additional $4.5 billion in income support to these vulnerable groups.\n",
            "My Fellow Guyanese,\n",
            "I now wish to announce a further set of measures aimed at providing $2.6 billion worth of additional support to the most vulnerable in our society. These are:\n",
            "A one-off grant of $25,000 to all old age pensioners, equivalent to one month of old age pension. This grant will benefit almost 65,000 persons, and place an additional $1.6 billion of disposable income in the hands of our elderly. I wish to reiterate that this $25,000 one-off grant is equivalent to additional month of pension to every Guyanese pensioner in every community.\n",
            "Secondly, one-off grant of $25,000 to all public assistance recipients and persons living with disabilities. This grant will benefit about 25,000 persons, and place more than $600 million of additional disposable income in their pockets.\n",
            "Thirdly an electricity credit paid to GPL on behalf of households consuming not more than 75 kilowatt-hours per month. The credit to each household will be equivalent to one month of their electricity bill, and will inject more than $200 million of disposable income to more than 40,000 households. I wish to repeat this, targeting the most vulnerable again, those persons, those households in our society would receive the equivalent of one-month’s free electricity in these new measures that I’m announcing, this will benefit directly more than 40,000 households across the country.\n",
            "Together, these three new measures will provide additional income support of $2.6 billion to our most vulnerable households.\n",
            "This comes on top of the COVID-19 relief cash grant that we rolled out as soon as we came into office and which is currently in its second phase. Once this phase is finished, the COVID-19 relief grants will have placed more than $8 billion in the hands of families across our country.\n",
            "My Government remains committed to supporting all Guyanese as we navigate the current challenges of our time, as we rebuild our country from the difficulties of the last five years, and as we work towards realising the prosperity that inevitably lies ahead for our country and all our citizens.\n",
            "My fellow Guyanese, tonight’s measures will bring $2.6B into the pockets and hands of ordinary Guyanese. This will go a long way in bringing relief. This is a Government that cares. This is your Government regardless of which community, which region you are from; this is your Government delivering to you again $2.6B challenging and difficult times. I say to you that we remind commitment and that in the coming months, we will continue to work in finding ways in which we will continue to make your lives easier and ways in which we will continue to make you more prosperous and ways in which we will deliver to you a life that is fulfilling and satisfying.\n",

            "Speech delivered at: 1st Sitting - Eleventh Parliament - 10 June, 2015\n",
            "On May 26, 2015, the President of Venezuela issued Decree No. 1.787 declaring an area that Venezuela now regards as its maritime space. The issuance of a Decree is well within President Maduro’s constitutional right.\n",
            "What, Mr. Speaker, is not his right is to utilize the sovereign territory of the Cooperative Republic of Guyana to generate maritime territory to meet Venezuela’s illegal ambitions. That is precisely what the Decree purports to do in relation to Guyana’s Essequibo. In addition, it mandates and authorizes the Venezuelan Navy to secure the area and clearly to prevent any other State from exploiting, without Venezuela’s consent, the resources of the area, an area that now includes a significant portion of Guyana’s maritime space.\n",
            "This Decree in its baseless and shameless attempt at usurping Guyana’s territory is also intended to deny Guyana its legitimate right to continue the pursuit of existing developmental initiatives. It is also intended to impact negatively on other pending and future developmental initiatives in that portion of Guyana’s legitimate maritime space that falls within the area circumscribed by the Decree.\n",
            "Contrary to the Venezuelan Government’s public statements, the Decree cannot be considered an act of sovereignty where it applies to territory that does not belong to Venezuela. It flies in the face of all norms and principles of international law and it negates the very commitments assented to by Venezuela in numerous international and regional fora regarding the peaceful settlement of disputes. Guyana condemns this Decree in the strongest possible terms.\n",
            "In a recent public release and in a Statement communicated to me by the Venezuelan Ambassador resident here, the Venezuelan Government is claiming that it has done nothing wrong in issuing the Decree. It asserts that over the years it has been very kindly disposed towards Guyana and indeed virtually accuses the Government of Guyana of over reacting. Let it be clear, however, that our response to what, from our perspective, can only be described as an act of territorial aggrandizement.\n",
            "What then really is Venezuela’s intention in taking this illegal step? Mr. Speaker, please permit me to dilate momentarily on an aspect of our relations with Venezuela which has been a constant underlying theme and which puts in clear perspective what Guyana has had to face over the past almost 50 years. I will pass over the continuing illegal occupation of Guyana’s half of the island of Ankoko and the several unlawful incursions over those early years in thinly veiled attempts at claiming sovereignty over parts of the Essequibo region. I will make only passing reference to the many attempts at hindering development of this region, including Venezuela’s intervention seeking to prevent the implementation of the hydroelectric project in the Upper Mazaruni area and the pressure Venezuela has exerted at various times to discourage foreign investment in the region. All of these acts of military, para military and economic aggression have been well documented.\n",
            "Instead, I shall fast forward to more recent times. Honourable Members will recall that in 2013 a Venezuelan naval vessel seized a seismic vessel conducting surveys in Guyana’s maritime space on behalf of Anadarko, a Company that had been granted exploration rights. The action created a climate of uncertainty among potential investors in Guyana’s maritime space. Exxon-Mobil is amongst the companies that continued to work on its concession area, in spite of the use of force by Venezuela against the Teknik Perdana. In fact, no reasonable observer could have possibly anticipated that Venezuela could ever regard the position where the Deep Water Champion is located as even remotely falling within the areas claimed by Venezuela. Clearly, as was revealed at the end of February, we all underestimated Venezuela’s appetite for territory. Decree No. 1.787 has confirmed.\n",
            "Efforts at getting Venezuela to do the logical and reasonable thing, namely, sitting down to discuss the issue of maritime delimitation have to date proved futile. In this context it may be recalled that on September 30, 2011 my predecessor and her Venezuelan counterpart,\n",
            "“recognized that the delimitation of the maritime boundaries between their two States remains an outstanding issue and agreed that such delimitation will require negotiations”.\n",
            "Needless to say, such negotiations never took place despite Guyana’s best efforts to convene a meeting for this purpose.\n",
            "In passing it is instructive to note that the Anadarko incident just referred to, occurred just a few months after President Maduro of Venezuela visited Guyana. In a Joint Declaration with President Ramotar they expressed their satisfaction with the result of their dialogue and welcomed its promise for the enhancement of relations between the two countries. On that same day, a group of Venezuelans accompanied by armed military personnel landed at Eteringbang. A few weeks later there was a similar occurrence by opposition Venezuelan legislators who indicated that their presence was part of an act of sovereignty!\n",
            "Just last year as part of its development programme and in pursuit of initiatives already agreed to within UNASUR, Guyana and Brazil began a programme that involved, inter alia, the examination of hydropower development in parts of the Essequibo region. The Government of Venezuela, also a member of UNASUR, formally objected to this development and requested both the Brazilian Government and the Brazilian firm undertaking the feasibility studies to desist from carrying out any action in what the Venezuelan Government described as being ‘unquestionably Venezuelan territory’. A similar sentiment was communicated to Guyana. Venezuela insisted that its consent was required before any significant action could take place on Guyana’s territory! Those approaches and that insistence have been roundly rejected.\n",
            "The Arbitral Award of 1899 definitively established the boundary between Guyana and Venezuela. It is clear that Venezuela, by the aforesaid actions, is no longer contending that the Arbitral Award of 1899 is null and void. The inescapable conclusion, and one which portents grave danger to regional and international peace and security, is that the Venezuelan Government has now elevated the contention of nullity and invalidity to an assertion of fact. The Decree implies that international norms and good practices are not applicable to Venezuela and, consequently, that the Decree with respect to the Essequibo region as well as the maritime space the region provides is ipso facto Venezuelan territory.\n",
            "It is difficult for a dispassionate observer to determine what has propelled the Government of Venezuela to take this so patently illegal action – an action that flies in the face of all the norms and conventions that govern relations between States. Guyana has always sought the principled route in response to Venezuela’s persistent and continuing acts of aggression and will continue to do so. We have been in contact with several members of the international community and have made special approaches to other Member States of the Caribbean and of the Commonwealth from whom we have consistently received support in the past to our just cause. Other steps are being taken to ensure that Guyana’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are not compromised in any way and, that our sovereign right to develop this great country free from threats and acts of economic aggression remains untrammeled.\n",
            "For 49 years we have lived in the shadow of Venezuela’s illegal claim and attempts to despoil our country. The sword of Damocles, for the most part unseen, nevertheless hangs over our heads. Unless removed, it will be the legacy that will be inherited by our children. It is time to end this cycle. A definitive solution has to be found that will put to rest Venezuela’s contention of nullity.\n",
            "Venezuela has, by its recent Decree, virtually given notice that it intends to continue increasing the pressure on Guyana and to weaken our resistance to its illegal claim. We will not waiver in our resistance.\n",
            "Apart from the diplomatic and related measures of resistance to which I have just alluded, there is also a legal instrument assented to by Guyana, the United Kingdom and Venezuela, which provides for the examination of Venezuela’s contention that the Arbitral Award of 1899 is null and void. It also provides mechanisms for the eventual settlement of that baseless contention. The Geneva Agreement of 1966 remains the best hope for keeping the issue between Guyana and Venezuela from going totally out of control. The mandate of the Secretary General of the United Nations under this Agreement is quite clear. It is very specific.\n",
            "According to Article IV (2) … the Secretary General of the United Nations shall choose another of the means stipulated in Article 33 of the Charter of the United Nations, and so on until the controversy has been resolved or until all the means of peaceful settlement there contemplated have been exhausted.\n",
            "For more than 25 years the Good Offices Process, as one of the chosen means of peaceful settlement, has been in operation. Unhappily, it has signally failed to resolve the issue. The Decree of 26 May, 2015, has served to widen even further the gap between Guyana and Venezuela.\n",
            "Notwithstanding the fact that an International Boundary Settlement already exists in the form of the Arbitral Award of 1899, a juridical settlement in respect of Venezuela’s contention that this Award is null and void appears to be the best, if not the only way now open to us.\n",
            "To that eventuality we must now direct our full attention. Guyana of course stands ready to continue discussions with Venezuela with respect to our bilateral relations while we pursue a peaceful settlement within the framework of the Geneva Agreement where the UN Secretary General has a defined role.

DELIVERY]\\nSalutations\\nSitaram – Namashkar – ASalaam u alaikum – Good evening\\nI am deeply honoured to join with you in marking the centenary of the end of recruitment of Indian Indentures to the British colonies, including T&T.', '\\nI found nearly 100 individual ordinances relating to different aspects of immigration.', '\\nThere were three attempts to consolidate the immigration/ indentureship laws, through:\\nOrdinance 24 of 1854\\nOrdinances of 1870 and 1875 (Ordinance 13 of 1870 and 9 of 1875) and\\nOrdinance 26 of 1916 (Chapter 245).', '\\nThat it is, therefore, necessary and expedient to provide, at the public expense, such means of giving facility to immigration as may secure to the colony a sufficient number of labourers accustomed to agriculture, and inured to labour in a tropical climate.', '\\nFurther the Governor was given the power to appoint a person to become the Agent-General of the immigrants.', ' The Agent-General was required to register each immigrant and oversee the employment of the immigrants with employers.', ' 18 and 19 of 1844 which permitted Trinidad to raise 250,000 UKP through the issuance of bonds for promoting the immigration of agricultural labourers from the British Dominions in India and elsewhere.', ' MacLeod to introduce a minimum wage for indentured labourers by correspondence dated 19 April 1845:\\nWith respect to your suggestion to fix a minimum rate of wages, with liberty to the emigrant to demand a free passage back whenever they fall below it, I would observe that the contingency against which it is proposed to guard is one which you consider neither near nor probable, and that, therefore, it appears to be hardly worthwhile to provide against it now, especially as interference with the course of wages is in itself objectionable in principle.', ' The better plan I think will be to stop the current of immigration for a season, whenever wages are found to be falling too low.', '\\nOrdinance 3 of 1847 (which came into effect on 1 March 1847) placed into law many of the basic components of indentureship, for example it provided, inter alia:\\nA registry of immigrants was to be created and maintained\\nAfter five years’ industrial residence, all registered immigrants were entitled a free passage back.', '\\nThere was a tax penalty of 5 s per month for any labourer not under written contract\\nThe hours of labour were to be contracted to\\nEmployers had to provide a medical attendant for immigrants\\nA Superintendant of Immigrants was to be appointed who would be permitted to enter estates and inspect immigrants.', '\\nNo registered immigrant was permitted to leave the colony without a passport.', '\\nThe Secretary of Colonies requested that the Ordinance be made applicable to all immigrants, not just East Indian immigrants and it was repealed and Ordinance 9 of 1847.', '[3]\\nThe Legislature passed Ordinance 3 of 1849 which replaced Ordinance 9 of 1847 and added a provision that required that an indentured labourer contract for a minimum term of 5 years with a single employer and that in any case if the contract was signed before the immigrant turned 16 that the contract would determine at the age of 21 with the rate of wages to be determined by the Governor after the first year.', ' Further immigrants entering after January 1854 had to reside in the colony for 10 years to become eligible for return passage and pay part of their return passage.', '\\nORDINANCE 5 of 1857\\nOrdinance 5 of 1857 authorised contracts of service for five years with Immigrants from certain places and to give validity to certain contracts of service.', '\\nORDINANCE 14 of 1859\\nOrdinance 14 of 1859 was passed to facilitate the Introduction of Indian Immigrants at the Expense of Private Persons which permitted private persons to provide funding to the State to transport immigrants in addition to those paid for by the public purse.', ' Knaggs indicated that a telegram had been received from the Secretary of State of the Colonies (Andrew Bonar Law) which stated:\\nYou will receive by next mail a despatch announcing that the Government of India has decided to abolish indentured Emigration.', '\\nDuring the debate of the bill reference was made to a Committee which was appointed in London in 1909 to study emigration to the colonies.', '\\nThey came to Trinidad in 1913 and discovered a large number of prosecutions were being carried out under the immigration laws.', ' Their recommendations were largely targeted at reducing the penalties under the immigration laws.', '\\nOrdinance 26 of 1916 covered a wide breadth of law, within its provisions there are laws applicable to: contract, property, housing, rations, wages, health, marriage (and the registration of marriages), divorce, criminal sanctions, court procedure and of course immigration.', '\\nDuring the debate the Protector of Immigrants noted:\\nThe Indian Government with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, has decided on the abolition of the indenture system of immigration.', ' This will mean that immigrants will be under indenture for at least five years and probably ten years more.', ' The Indian Government also does not wish to entirely prohibit the importation of labour from India and is willing that we should get immigrants, but under other conditions.', '\\nWith the passage of Chapter 245, the further step was taken of completely abolishing imprisonment for labour offences under the immigration laws and replacing imprisonment with fines alone.', '\\nThis was replaced by a system in which the immigrant would be brought before a Stipendiary Justice of the Peace and then returned to his estate.', '\\nOther protections of immigrants found in the ordinance were a maximum 6 day work week of 9 hours per day with a minimum wage of one shilling and one-half penny.', '\\nThe immigrant was to receive a 30 minute rest period after working for four and one-half hours.', ' Immigrants were given the right of complaint to the Protector of Immigrants if they were dissatisfied with the wages paid by their employer.', '\\nIf an immigrant was assaulted or ill-treated the penalty was ten pounds and/or two months imprisonment.', '\\nThere were two provisions that the Protector of Immigration made note of were:\\nSection 199 which gave the indentured immigrant the right to commute his indenture at any time during his period of indenture by giving one month’s notice to his employer and paying a fee of six shillings and eight pence for every month of service and 2 and one-half pence for each additional day of service left in his contract.', '\\nSection 237 required that any complaint to be made against an immigrant must be made within one month of the action that led to the complaint and an employer must receive consent in writing from the Protector of Immigrants or the Inspector of Immigrants.', '\\n[3] Other immigrants would be excepted from provisions which only related to indentured labourers\\nShare this: Facebook\\nTwitter\\nEmail\\nWhatsApp.']\n",
