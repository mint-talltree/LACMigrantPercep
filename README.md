Code to scrape and analyze Latin American governmental speeches to find perceptions toward migrants.

This work was created as part of an internship.

SpeechScraper, as the name suggests, scrapes the governmental speeches based on the input excel file containing the necessary paths. Please create the excel file since HTML locations may change over time.

Sentiment_and_Emotion_Analysis is the file for sentiment analysis portion.

Perceptions_GovSpeech contains both files so that one can conduct everything in one go.
